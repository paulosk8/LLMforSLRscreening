art4;Integrated Webapp For Campus Placement. Many institutions now do not have a platform where students can view all of the offers from various firms, and they must fill out the form with their information again for each company that visits. To minimize future problems, the college placement department must check each student's information. Companies rely on the Placement department to obtain information about selected applicants for additional procedures. To solve this problem, a platform for students to register and submit their updated profiles was required. Companies can see the applications received for a specific job vacancy, admin can approve or reject the student's registration based on the database present with him, and students can see various job openings from companies at a specific time. The current system is not a proper and appropriate method of implementing Training and Placement management because it becomes difficult for the placement department to manage all of the databases, send emails regarding offers to every student, and keep track of every student, whether they received an offer or not. As a result, this study created a platform for students to register and submit their updated profiles, reducing administrative effort. Companies get immediate access to the applications submitted for a specific employment opportunity. Features are supplied to immediately generate information from existing data. This study recommended segmenting the web app into three components for design: admin, company, and student. React JS is utilized as a frontend framework for development, Node JS as a server-side script for integration and REST operations, MongoDB and Mongoose for databases and connections, Redux for state management, and Axios for requests and answers.  ¬© 2023 IEEE.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art5;NGO Portal - A Platform to connect NGOs with prospective members.

This paper explores the integration of Docker and microservices architecture for developing scalable web applications. Docker's containerization Technology enables packaging applications and related dependencies to be integrated into portable containers, providing advantages such as rapid startup times, reduced resource consumption, and flexible deployment options. This study highlights the use of Docker in a microservices framework, encompassing components such as client applications, Docker containers, microservices, and the database layer. The proposed system leverages Docker to develop a web application with Angular for the front end and Node.js for the back end, deployed on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The key aspects of the implementation include SSL/TLS configuration for secure communication, the use of middleware for authentication and session management, and a robust database connection setup with MongoDB and Mongoose. Performance analysis compares Docker containers with traditional virtual machines, demonstrating superior resource efficiency and faster deployment times.  ¬© 2024 IEEE.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art8;Mechanisms and techniques to enhance the security of big data analytic framework with MongoDB and Linux Containers. The frequency and scale of unauthorized access cases and misuses of data access privileges are a growing concern of many organizations. The protection of confidential data, such as social security numbers, financial information, etc., of the customers and/or employees is among the key responsibilities of any organization, and damage to such sensitive data can easily pose a threat to the future of a business and the security of the customers. Therefore, this paper proposes and implements some security mechanisms and techniques, such as secure authentication, secure authorization, and encryption, to assure the overall security of a big data analytic framework with MongoDB free community edition. This paper presents the fourth phase of our continuous research where in the first phase we proposed a data analytic framework with MongoDB and Linux Containers (LXCs) with basic security requirements. Next, in the second phase we proposed a vulnerability analysis testbed to find vulnerabilities associated with the system. Finally, in the third phase we discussed in detail root causes and some prevention techniques of vulnerabilities found in the system. In addition, this paper introduces a new security mechanism for privacy preserving data handling with MongoDB to ensure the privacy of the data before being processed. Our results show, with our initial model of the analytic framework, how well our newly introduced security mechanisms work and how these security mechanisms and techniques can be used to assure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of any data science project conducted on our proposed analytic framework. In addition, these security mechanisms and techniques help us to strengthen the current system against zero-day attacks where attacks on vulnerabilities that have not been patched or made public yet. Therefore, our vulnerability analysis testbed which is proposed in the second phase of this research will not be able to finds vulnerabilities related to zero-day attacks.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art9;A home hospitalization system based on the Internet of things, Fog computing and cloud computing. In recent years, the world has witnessed a significant increase in the number of elderly who often suffer from chronic diseases, and has witnessed in recent months a major spread of the new coronavirus (COVID-19), which has led to thousands of deaths, especially among the elderly and people who suffer from chronic diseases. Coronavirus has also caused many problems in hospitals, where these are no longer able to accommodate a large number of patients. This virus has also begun to spread between medical and paramedical teams, and this causes a major risk to the health of patients staying in hospitals. To reduce the spread of the virus and maintain the health of patients who need a hospital stay, home hospitalization is one of the best possible solutions. This paper proposes a home hospitalization system based on the Internet of Things (IoT), Fog computing, and Cloud computing, which are among the most important technologies that have contributed to the development of the healthcare sector in a significant way. These systems allow patients to recover and receive treatment in their homes and among their families, where patient health and the hospitalization room environmental state are monitored, to enable doctors to follow the hospitalization process and make recommendations to patients and their supervisors, through monitoring units and mobile applications developed for this purpose. The results of evaluation have shown great acceptance of this system by patients and doctors alike.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art10;Using Apache Airavata and EasyGateway for the creation of complex science gateway front-end. The development of community-specific user interfaces of a science gateway can be a challenging task for non-IT experts. This contribution proposes an original, easy-to-use solution to tackle this issue based on EasyGateway. EasyGateway is a modern, lightweight solution for the development of science gateway able to interplay with most toolkits. In this paper we present how EasyGateway can ‚Äúdress‚Äù Apache Airavata to manage experiment configurations and job submissions. We discuss the proposed approach considering a real case application represented by the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF), a community model exploited by a large number of users in meteorology and climatology domains. The combined use of EasyGateway and Apache Airavata leads to an improved user experience, enhancing the model configuration phase with support in finding inconsistencies immediately, but also exploiting the possibility of accessing a potentially large set of computational resources to perform model execution.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art11;CommBo: Modernizing Augmentative and Alternative Communication. For every 100,000 people, there are 536 individuals with speech impairments who can benefit from the use of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices (Creer et¬†al., 2016). Existing AAC devices can suffer from the shortcomings of being difficult to adjust to the user‚Äôs specific needs or simply being expensive to own and maintain. We aim to reduce the impact of these problems with CommBo: a web-based, speech-generating picture communication board meant to alleviate some major difficulties commonly experienced by AAC users. CommBo offers customizability beyond that of a physical picture board and leverages machine learning to provide intelligent suggestions. It supports heightened communication that can be brought to a multitude of computing devices, including those that are low-cost or have limited internet access. CommBo is designed for those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and patients suffering from any trauma that impacts the person‚Äôs ability to communicate effectively, e.g., stroke-induced aphasia. Across two studies, target and non-target participants evaluated CommBo in terms of functionality and usability, and results showed significant benefits of the system.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art12;A science gateway for Exploring the X-ray Transient and variable sky using EGI Federated Cloud. Modern soft X-ray observatories can yield unique insights into time domain astrophysics, and a huge amount of information is stored ‚Äì and largely unexploited ‚Äì in data archives. Like a treasure-hunt, the EXTraS project harvested the hitherto unexplored temporal domain information buried in the serendipitous data collected by the European Photon Imaging Camera instrument onboard the ESA XMM-Newton, in 16 years of observations. All results have been released to the scientific community, together with new software analysis tools. This paper presents the architecture of the EXTraS science gateway, that has the goal to provide the software through a web based portal using the EGI Federated Cloud infrastructure.

art13;What Do Practitioners Discuss about IoT and Industry 4.0 Related Technologies? Characterization and Identification of IoT and Industry 4.0 Categories in Stack Overflow Discussions. Internet of Things and Industry 4.0‚Äìrelated discussions have become increasingly prevalent on several online Q&A websites in recent years. Analyzing and understanding such discussions could provide practitioners with more insights into various trends in the evolution of topics of interest and help different research communities, including software development and industrial sectors, better understand the needs and challenges facing practitioners as they operate in these fields. We conduct an exploratory study to capture and compare the popularity as well as the effect of the discussion topics on the domain across such communities. We use extracted data from popular online Q&A websites, such as Stack Exchange, and investigate 176,819 posts to investigate what practitioners are asking and looking for. We also use Machine Learning for Language Toolkit (MALLET) based‚ÄìLatent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic models to help summarize Internet of Things/Industry 4.0‚Äìrelated questions, identify the most challenging popular related issues, explore specific issues of the Internet of Things/Industry 4.0, and investigate the types of questions that practitioners ask about. We summarize all the topics into various categories and evaluate the popularity and difficulty of various topics as well. Our findings help to highlight the challenges facing the Internet of Things/Industry 4.0 practitioners which in the future would require more attention from various research and software development communities and develop new approaches to analyzing questions posed on various Q&A forums.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art14;Authentication and Authorization in Modern Web Apps for Data Security Using Nodejs and Role of Dark Web. Authentication and Authorization are the base of security for all the Technologies present in this world today. Starting from your smartphone where a user authenticates himself before he could access the data inside to Entering into the White House, you must authenticate yourself, and based on that you are authorized. In this digital world where every Business, MNC, Government Body, Companies, Users, etc. needs a website to inform the world about their presence on the internet, provide services online and become a ‚ÄúBrand‚Äù, the risk of leaking user's sensitive information increases. It could be dangerous to the users of the hacked website because their sensitive information like a credit card, bank account details, etc. could be sold in the black market of the ‚Äúdark web‚Äù. The role of the dark web is described in the paper and how the data is sold there and what becomes of it. The paper helps to understand how a secure website is developed that promises the user to keep the sensitive information safe, increases the bond of trust between a client and server which results in a long-term relationship. The aim behind developing an authentication system is to keep users‚Äô sensitive information safe so that hackers cannot steal and sell the information on the dark web's back market. To perform this, the developer needs to understand how to implement authentication. NodeJS, with the help of its framework expressJS and some other packages, is used to develop the authentication and authorization system of the website by the research. Previous papers on this field covered the authentication topic in general. This paper overcame that by going deeper into the field and being server-side language specific. The common types of authentication methods used in different types of websites are discussed in detail and the best methods are purposed for the developer to be implemented for a more secure website. This research put light on Artificial Intelligence and blockchain as the future of security of big data.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

art16;Kubernetes and IoT-based next-generation scalable energy management framework for residential clusters. Rising energy demands lead to higher electricity costs, overburdened power grids, and increased carbon emissions. Implementing load scheduling through home energy management systems (HEMS) offers a solution, but existing systems have limitations, especially in optimization algorithms, objective functions, and integration across households. This study introduces an innovative Kubernetes and IoT-based HEMS for residential clusters. The goal is to optimize energy consumption by reducing electricity bills, peak-to-average ratio (PAR), and user inconvenience applying a Multi-Objective PUMA Optimization (MPO) technique. Thus, the proposed HEMS model innovatively adapts the PUMA algorithm into a multi-objective framework, deploys Kubernetes, and validates through a prototype. IoT-enabled data collection and user preferences are processed by smart scheduler hub (SSH) to generate optimal appliance schedules, executed via smart plugs for convenience and cost-effectiveness. Simulations show that the MPO technique reduces daily electricity expenses by 11.89% and PAR by 54.58%. A techno-economic analysis compares HEMS alone, HEMS with Photovoltaic (PV) systems, and HEMS with PV and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), with payback periods of 1.60, 1.75, and 11 years, respectively. The study also evaluates carbon footprint reductions, with HEMS alone achieving an 8.4% reduction in CO2 emissions. Furthermore, the proposed solution is designed to be scalable across multiple clusters, thereby enhancing smart grid advancements.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art17;Digital twin-based intelligent fish farming with Artificial Intelligence Internet of Things (AIoT). This paper focuses on designing a Digital Twin infrastructure that supports an agile-based Artificial Intelligence Internet of Things (AIoT) system for intelligent fish farming in aquaculture. Our infrastructure includes the Internet of Things, cloud technology, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) as its building blocks. Our physical entity is equipped with smart devices such as sensors and actuators embedded in smart machines (fish feeding and sorting machines) that collect and transmits big data to the cloud using wireless communication networks for real-time and remote monitoring. We have four major digital twin services: fish feeding to automate the feeding process, metric estimation (fish count, size, and weight), environmental monitoring (water condition, net hole, and green algae), and health monitoring (vitality, mortality, and diseases). Each digital twin service is equipped with multiple AI services (or the digital twin objects) capable of performing complex and other functions such as optimizations, predictions, and analyses for intelligent decision-making to optimize farm profits and production. We integrated a prototype that represents the virtual entity accessible using the web and mobile devices where users can perform fish farm monitoring using the various digital twin services and their related AI services.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art18;SafE-Tag mobile: A novel javascript framework for real-time management of unsafe conditions and unsafe acts in SMEs. Nowadays industries have initiative to reduce a number of production injuries and accidents down to zero. This goal could be achieved only through the proactive identification of accident precursors ‚Äì such as unsafe conditions (UC) and unsafe acts (UA), whose control could prevent occurrence of accidents. At the same time, smartphones (and mobile applications) are taking dominance over PCs, making mobile devices major interface for human interaction with the web. In this term, application of mobile devices in OSH remains to be more exploited and accepted. Takin into account these trends, the present study aims to propose a novel cloud-based mobile framework for the management of UC/UA reports. Compared to previous studies, we considered the recent trends of mobile, cloud and Safety 4.0 in more details ‚Äì ending up with the solution that is the combo of JavaScript technologies. Additionally, we provided a publically available use case named the SafE-Tag. Particularly, the SafE-Tag was implemented using the React Native for mobile application, Node.js for web-services and Mongo.db NoSQL cloud database. Beside elaborated computational efficiency, these technologies were found as the most optimal in terms of the cost/complexity to develop and/or adapt in an arbitrary SME. It is concluded that the proposed framework brings benefits for both employees and employers through: (1) intuitive and user friendly identification of key safety performance indicators;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art19;Android Based Job Search Application ‚ÄúMegawe‚Äù for The Segment of Workers with an Education Level Below a University Degree. Indonesia is a vast market for talents recruiting, with around 203 million people that count into work age definition (above 15 years) and around 138 million of them are workforce, while 7 percent of the workforce are open for hire. There are several players of job-seeking apps in Indonesia. But most of them are targeting talents with undergraduate degrees and above. Mid to high-level jobs have become such an attractive market for these players. We can see it on several job seeker hub websites, where job seekers proudly post their personal profiles to attract recruiters from top employers. It is not possible for lower-level job seekers to post their profiles on these websites. They will just be under the recruiter's radar. Whereas from the report data released by the Indonesian statistical center bureau regarding the percentage of open unemployment based on education level, the total unemployment rate from diploma education and below is very large compared to the unemployment rate with university education (undergraduate and above). The Covid-19 pandemic also gave a negative impact on the lower job segment, with a decrease in demand and sales resulting in a higher layoff rate which also means an increased percentage of the open unemployment rate. We need a solution to this problem. A solution that can erode a large chunk hidden under an iceberg. This paper offers ‚ÄúMegawe‚Äù, a mobile application-based solution to assist both job seekers and low-level job recruiters. This segment may have a smaller contract value than upper segments but has a much larger quantity of labor force. Because we are focusing on development speed and accuracy of requirements, we used the prototyping methodology in the implementation of the solution. Moreover, before it is launched publicly, we conducted usability testing to gain a deeper understanding of the user experience directly from users of the targeted segment.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art20;An empirical study of COVID-19 related posts on Stack Overflow: Topics and technologies. The COVID-19 outbreak, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, has left its mark on every aspect of our lives and at the time of this writing is still an ongoing battle. Beyond the immediate global-wide health response, the pandemic has triggered a significant number of IT initiatives to track, visualize, analyze and potentially mitigate the phenomenon. For individuals or organizations interested in developing COVID-19 related software, knowledge-sharing communities such as Stack Overflow proved to be an effective source of information for tackling commonly encountered problems. As an additional contribution to the investigation of this unprecedented health crisis and to assess how fast and how well the community of developers has responded, we performed a study on COVID-19 related posts in Stack Overflow. In particular, we profiled relevant questions based on key post features and their evolution, identified the most prominent technologies adopted for developing COVID-19 software and their interrelations and focused on the most persevering problems faced by developers. For the analysis of posts we employed descriptive statistics, Association Rule Graphs, Survival Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The results reveal that the response of the developers‚Äô community to the pandemic was immediate and that the interest of developers on COVID-19 related challenges was sustained after its initial peak. In terms of the problems addressed, the results show a clear focus on COVID-19 data collection, analysis and visualization from/to the web, in line with the general needs for monitoring the pandemic.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In IBN systems, conflict detection and policy resolution modules are crucial to intent activation to enforce correct network configurations. To this end, in this study, we propose an extensible intent model, complemented with a conflict detection algorithm. We also propose a policy resolution algorithm that is based on a two-dimensional analysis of intent endpoints and time spans. To better showcase the efficiency of our algorithm, we also developed an enterprise-based IBN intent management web application for network users and administrators. Our evaluation experiments reveal the effectiveness of our algorithms in terms of reliable resolutions and fast response time.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

art24;An artificial intelligence based crowdsensing solution for on-demand accident scene monitoring. Road traffic crashes have a devastating impact on societies by claiming more than 1.35 million lives each year and causing up to 50 million injuries. Improving the efficiency of emergency management systems constitutes a key measure to reduce road traffic deaths and injuries. In this work, we propose a comprehensive crowdsensing-based solution for the real-time collection and the analysis of accident scene intelligence as a means to improve the efficiency of the emergency response process and help reduce road fatalities. The solution leverages sensory, mobile, and web technologies for the real-time monitoring of accident scenes, and employs Artificial Intelligence for the automatic analysis of the accident scene data, to allow the automatic generation of accident intelligence reports. Police officers and rescue teams can use those reports for fast and accurate situational assessment and effective response to emergencies. The proposed system was fully implemented and its operation was successfully tested using a variety of scenarios. This work gives interesting insights into the possibility of leveraging crowdsensing and artificial intelligence for offering emergency situational awareness and improving the efficiency of emergency response operations.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art25;An empirical investigation on the competences and roles of practitioners in Microservices-based Architectures. Microservices-based Architectures (MSAs) are gaining popularity since, among others, they enable rapid and independent delivery of software at scale, facilitating the delivery of business value. Additionally, there are attempts towards understanding practitioners‚Äô roles and technical knowledge. MSAs call for affinity in several technologies as well as business domains. This diversity makes it challenging to scope and describe the roles of practitioners. In addition, practitioners often do not receive training and contents of MSA training remain largely undefined, even though there are challenges in finding or developing relevant technical expertise. In this research, we determine the different technical roles that are required in MSAs, along with their detailed competences. We use public online forums (e.g., StackOverflow), where developers share technical knowledge. We analyze 13,517 public profiles of software engineers, deriving their technical competences. Our taxonomy of technical competences in MSAs, contains 11 competences clusters, organized in 3 collections of competences ‚Äî Web Technologies, DevOps, and Data Technologies. In addition, we derive the roles of microservice practitioners and the characteristics of their roles. Our findings organize the technical competences of MSAs practitioners and determine the training topics and combination of topics that can prepare engineers for MSAs.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To process, visualize, and analyse data, the web application developed allows users to understand quickly and easily the patterns and trends related to energy consumption through various graphics, providing a clear and accessible visual presentation of the data that helps them make decisions to optimize energy consumption. In addition, an application has been developed that allows to assess whether or not removing the anti-feeding system and modifying the contract with the distribution company may be favourable.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art28;On the Discoverability of npm Vulnerabilities in Node.js Projects. The reliance on vulnerable dependencies is a major threat to software systems. Dependency vulnerabilities are common and remain undisclosed for years. However, once the vulnerability is discovered and publicly known to the community, the risk of exploitation reaches its peak, and developers have to work fast to remediate the problem. While there has been a lot of research to characterize vulnerabilities in software ecosystems, none have explored the problem taking the discoverability into account. Therefore, we perform a large-scale empirical study examining 6,546 Node.js applications. We define three discoverability levels based on vulnerabilities lifecycle (undisclosed, reported, and public). We find that although the majority of the affected applications (99.42%) depend on undisclosed vulnerable packages, 206&nbsp;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art29;InspectJS: leveraging code similarity and user-feedback for effective taint specification inference for JavaScript - Proceedings of the 44th International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Practice. Static analysis has established itself as a weapon of choice for detecting security vulnerabilities. Taint analysis in particular is a very general and powerful technique, where security policies are expressed in terms of forbidden flows, either from untrusted input sources to sensitive sinks (in integrity policies) or from sensitive sources to untrusted sinks (in confidentiality policies). The appeal of this approach is that the taint-tracking mechanism has to be implemented only once, and can then be parameterized with different taint specifications (that is, sets of sources and sinks, as well as any sanitizers that render otherwise problematic flows innocuous) to detect many different kinds of vulnerabilities.But while techniques for implementing scalable inter-procedural static taint tracking are fairly well established, crafting taint specifications is still more of an art than a science, and in practice tends to involve a lot of manual effort.Past work has focussed on automated techniques for inferring taint specifications for libraries either from their implementation or from the way they tend to be used in client code. Among the latter, machine learning-based approaches have shown great promise.In this work we present our experience combining an existing machine-learning approach to mining sink specifications for JavaScript libraries with manual taint modelling in the context of GitHub's CodeQL analysis framework. We show that the machine-learning component can successfully infer many new taint sinks that either are not part of the manual modelling or are not detected due to analysis incompleteness. Moreover, we present techniques for organizing sink predictions using automated ranking and code-similarity metrics that allow an analysis engineer to efficiently sift through large numbers of predictions to identify true positives.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art30;A model for reasoning about JavaScript promises. In JavaScript programs, asynchrony arises in situations such as web-based user-interfaces, communicating with servers through HTTP requests, and non-blocking I/O. Event-based programming is the most popular approach for managing asynchrony, but suffers from problems such as lost events and event races, and results in code that is hard to understand and debug. Recently, ECMAScript 6 has added support for promises, an alternative mechanism for managing asynchrony that enables programmers to chain asynchronous computations while supporting proper error handling. However, promises are complex and error-prone in their own right, so programmers would benefit from techniques that can reason about the correctness of promise-based code. Since the ECMAScript 6 specification is informal and intended for implementers of JavaScript engines, it does not provide a suitable basis for formal reasoning. This paper presents Œªp, a core calculus that captures the essence of ECMAScript 6 promises. Based on Œªp, we introduce the promise graph, a program representation that can assist programmers with debugging of promise-based code. We then report on a case study in which we investigate how the promise graph can be helpful for debugging errors related to promises in code fragments posted to the StackOverflow website.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art31;Toward Better Comprehension of Breaking Changes in the NPM Ecosystem. Code evolution is prevalent in software ecosystems, which can provide many benefits, such as new features, bug fixes, security patches, while still introducing breaking changes that make downstream projects fail to work. Breaking changes cause a lot of effort to both downstream and upstream developers: downstream developers need to adapt to breaking changes and upstream developers are responsible for identifying and documenting them. In the NPM ecosystem, characterized by frequent code changes and a high tolerance for making breaking changes, the effort is larger.For better comprehension of breaking changes in the NPM ecosystem and to enhance breaking change detection tools, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to investigate breaking changes in the NPM ecosystem. We construct a dataset of explicitly documented breaking changes from 381 popular NPM projects. We find that 95.4% of the detected breaking changes can be covered by developers‚Äô documentation, and 19% of the breaking changes cannot be detected by regression testing. Then in the process of investigating source code of our collected breaking changes, we yield a taxonomy of JavaScript- and TypeScript-specific syntactic breaking changes and a taxonomy of major types of behavioral breaking changes. Additionally, we investigate the reasons why developers make breaking changes in NPM and find three major reasons, i.e., to reduce code redundancy, to improve identifier names, and to improve API design, and each category contains several sub-items.We provide actionable implications for future research, e.g., automatic naming and renaming techniques should be applied in JavaScript projects to improve identifier names, future research can try to detect more types of behavioral breaking changes. By presenting the implications, we also discuss the weakness of automatic renaming and breaking change detection approaches, such as the lack of support for public identifiers and various types of breaking changes.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art32;Detecting locations in JavaScript programs affected by breaking library changes. JavaScript libraries are widely used and evolve rapidly. When adapting client code to non-backwards compatible changes in libraries, a major challenge is how to locate affected API uses in client code, which is currently a difficult manual task. In this paper we address this challenge by introducing a simple pattern language for expressing API access points and a pattern-matching tool based on lightweight static analysis. Experimental evaluation on 15 popular npm packages shows that typical breaking changes are easy to express as patterns. Running the static analysis on 265 clients of these packages shows that it is accurate and efficient: it reveals usages of breaking APIs with only 14% false positives and no false negatives, and takes less than a second per client on average. In addition, the analysis is able to report its confidence, which makes it easier to identify the false positives. These results suggest that the approach, despite its simplicity, can reduce the manual effort of the client developers.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art33;Real time analytics of urban congestion trajectories on hadoop-mongoDB cloud ecosystem - Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Internet of Things, Data and Cloud Computing. Cities should invest significant budgets on technologies of the Internet of things in the next few years. One of the great challenges is to align technologies related to connected objects exploring the urban-cloud computing and big data analytics to intelligent urban traffic and congestion management. Traffic congestion in urban networks takes polymorphic forms and magnitudes. Technological advances on big data analytics, distributed processing on the cloud as well as new technologies of location-based services and traffic measurement are great support for the congestion management processes. This paper mainly discussed to formulate a new model of urban traffic congestion based on the trajectories meta-model and on some new algebraic structures. The idea is to consider congestion as a space-time event and its extent as a wave spreading modelled by a space-time path trajectory. It is also considering the issue of congestion such as infections that spread in a network. We define two algebra structures that meet the expectations of congestion management. These algebraic structures generate very useful congestion patterns for network traffic control and monitoring functions. For congestion trajectories temporal queries, mining purpose, and spatio-temporal visualization, these spacetime congestion paths will be stored in a MongoDB data warehouse operating in a Hadoop cloud-based eco-system. This approach is of great simplicity we have to operate later in the traffic management schemes.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art34;CrowdUI: Supporting Web Design with the Crowd. Web design is a complex and challenging task. It involves making many design decisions that materialise preconceived notions of user needs that may or may not be true. In this paper, we investigate supporting the co-design of a website with visual feedback elicited from the website's community of users. Website users can express their needs by re-arranging and modifying the website's layout and design. To explore and validate this idea, we present CrowdUI, a web-based tool that enables members of the community of a website to visually express their design improvement ideas, frustrations and needs, and to send this feedback to the person in charge of designing or maintaining the website.CrowdUI is validated in a study with 45 users of a popular social media and networking website. Second, our qualitative evaluation with 60 experienced web developers shows that CrowdUI is able to elicit diverse and meaningful feedback. Put together, our results suggest that CrowdUI's approach constitutes a productive setting for eliciting visual feedback from the user community as a complement to traditional ways of eliciting feedback and participatory design. Finally, based on our experiences, we discuss a design space for crowdsourced web design and provide design recommendations for similar future tools.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art35;ReactAppScan: Mining React Application Vulnerabilities via Component Graph - Proceedings of the 2024 on ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security. React, a single-page application framework, has recently become popular among web developers due to its flexible and convenient management of web application states via a syntax extension to JavaScript, called JSX (JavaScript and XML). Despite its abundant functionalities, the security of React, especially vulnerability detection, still lags: many existing vulnerability detection works do not support JSX let alone React Data Flow introduced by React components. The only exception is CodeQL, which supports JSX syntax. However, CodeQL cannot properly track React Data Flow across different components for detecting vulnerabilities.In this paper, we design a novel framework, called ReactAppScan, which constructs a Component Graph (CoG) for tracking React Data Flow and detecting vulnerabilities following both JavaScript and React data flows. Specifically, ReactAppScan relies on abstract interpretation to build such a component graph via tracking component lifecycles and then detects vulnerabilities via finding paths between sources and sinks. Our evaluation shows that ReactAppScan detects 61 zero-day vulnerabilities in real-world React applications. We have responsibly reported all the vulnerabilities and so far six vulnerabilities have been fixed and two have been acknowledged.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art36;ReBase: a framework for acquiring and managing body tracking data - Proceedings of the 26th Symposium on Virtual and Augmented Reality. There is a great deal of interest in developing virtual reality and augmented reality applications that require data storage, with which developers can interact and create intelligent systems for various purposes, such as applications for neuromotor rehabilitation. These applications provide the benefits of traditional rehabilitation without becoming overwhelming, as they allow the user to be immersed in various scenarios and situations. In addition, the way these applications interact makes it possible to retrieve and analyze the data generated by users‚Äô movements during treatment. However, it is tough to find datasets of body movements, and those that do exist do not include movements specific to the rehabilitation context. This paper, therefore, presents ReBase, a framework that provides a standardized storage system for body movement data. ReBase was designed to allow the collection of data generated by any application, regardless of the form of body tracking used. This paper presents an open API that can be used to communicate with the ReBase database, a package for the Unity game engine, and a library for the Python programming language, which facilitates the integration of new applications into the system. In addition, two applications are shown as case studies within and outside the health area, developed using the tool.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we present a web annotation application tailored to streamline the process of annotating 3D organ volumes using preprocessed 2D images data. Our platform introduces advanced annotation assistance and predictive inference to significantly enhance medical imaging workflows. Although we leverage curated sets of 2D images rather than the original 3D volume data, our innovative approach focuses on optimizing the annotation process and integrating predictive algorithms to improve accuracy. By capitalizing on the preprocessing step of 3D volume segmentation dataset, we offer a solution that expedites the creation of accurate organ segmentation, ultimately contributes to more efficient medical image analysis.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art38;DSL-Xpert: LLM-driven Generic DSL Code Generation - Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE 27th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems. Nowadays, large language models (LLMs) are an extremely useful and fast tool to complement and help in many jobs and current problems. However, there are cases where a pretty specific vocabulary is used in which these models were not previously trained, leading to less satisfactory results. More specifically, these models are less effective when dealing with less-known or unpublished domain-specific languages (DSLs). Within this field, the automatic generation of code based on such languages, starting from natural language, would speed up the development times of any related project, as well as the understanding of such DSLs. Therefore, this paper presents a tool in which developers can perform what is known as semantic parsing. In other words, the developer can ask a pre-trained LLM to translate a natural language instruction into the vocabulary of the established DSL. Thus, by setting the DSL grammar as context (grammar prompting) and providing usage examples (few-shot learning), the LLM can quickly generate reliable domain-specific code, significantly improving the quality of life of the developers. A video demonstration of the tool is shown in the following link: https://zenodo.org/records/12610506.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art39;No strings attached: an empirical study of string-related software bugs - Proceedings of the 35th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering. Strings play many roles in programming because they often contain complex and semantically rich information. For example, programmers use strings to filter inputs via regular expression matching, to express the names of program elements accessed through some form of reflection, to embed code written in another formal language, and to assemble textual output produced by a program. The omnipresence of strings leads to a wide range of mistakes that developers may make, yet little is currently known about these mistakes. The lack of knowledge about string-related bugs leads to developers repeating the same mistakes again and again, and to poor support for finding and fixing such bugs. This paper presents the first empirical study of the root causes, consequences, and other properties of string-related bugs. We systematically study 204 string-related bugs in a diverse set of projects written in JavaScript, a language where strings play a particularly important role. Our findings include (i) that many string-related mistakes are caused by a recurring set of root cause patterns, such as incorrect string literals and regular expressions, (ii) that string-related bugs have a diverse set of consequences, including incorrect output or silent omission of expected behavior, (iii) that fixing string-related bugs often requires changing just a single line, with many of the required repair ingredients available in the surrounding code, (iv) that string-related bugs occur across all parts of applications, including the core components, and (v) that almost none of these bugs are detected by existing static analyzers. Our findings not only show the importance and prevalence of string-related bugs, but they help developers to avoid common mistakes and tool builders to tackle the challenge of finding and fixing string-related bugs.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art40;Schemas and Types for JSON Data: From Theory to Practice - Proceedings of the 2019 International Conference on Management of Data. The last few years have seen the fast and ubiquitous diffusion of JSON as one of the most widely used formats for publishing and interchanging data, as it combines the flexibility of semistructured data models with well-known data structures like records and arrays. The user willing to effectively manage JSON data collections can rely on several schema languages, like JSON Schema, JSound, and Joi, as well as on the type abstractions offered by modern programming and scripting languages like Swift or TypeScript. The main aim of this tutorial is to provide the audience (both researchers and practitioners) with the basic notions for enjoying all the benefits that schema and types can offer while processing and manipulating JSON data. This tutorial focuses on four main aspects of the relation between JSON and schemas: (1) we survey existing schema language proposals and discuss their prominent features;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art41;"Node.fz: Fuzzing the Server-Side Event-Driven Architecture - Proceedings of the Twelfth European Conference on Computer Systems. The importance of the Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) has never been greater. Web servers and the IoT alike have begun to adopt the EDA, and the popular server-side EDA framework, Node.js, boasts the world's largest package ecosystem. While multi-threaded programming has been well studied in the literature, concurrency bug characteristics and useful development tools remain largely unexplored for server-side EDA-based applications.We present the first (to the best of our knowledge) concurrency bug characteristic study of real world open-source event-driven applications, based in Node.js. Like multithreaded programs, event-driven programs are prone to concurrency bugs like atomicity violations and order violations. Our study shows the forms that atomicity violations and ordering violations take in the EDA context, and points out the limitations of existing concurrency error detection tools developed for client-side EDA applications.Based on our bug study, we propose Node.fz, a novel testing aid for server-side event-driven programs. Node.fz is a schedule fuzzing test tool for event-driven programs, embodied for server-side Node.js programs. Node.fz randomly perturbs the execution of a Node.js program, allowing Node.js developers to explore a variety of possible schedules. Thanks to its low overhead, Node.fz enables a developer to explore a broader ""schedule space"" with the same test time budget, ensuring that applications will be stable in a wide variety of deployment conditions. We show that Node.fz can expose known bugs much more frequently than vanilla Node.js, and that it can uncover new bugs.";art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art42;Development of psychological support system for college students based on roschach ink trace test - Proceedings of the 2025 International Conference on Intelligent Systems, Automation and Control. This study developed a psychological support guarantee system based on the mental health problems of college students. Through the multi-level system design, including psychological evaluation, early warning and intervention, psychological counseling and counseling, and data management and analysis module, the comprehensive monitoring and intervention of students' psychological status are realized. The system uses advanced algorithms, such as principal component analysis (PCA), convolutional neural network (CNN), long and short-term memory network (LSTM), and Bayesian optimization (Bayesian Optimization), to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of the evaluation and intervention. The results of performance test and functional test show that the system is excellent in response speed, concurrent processing ability, resource use efficiency and data processing performance, and has efficient, stable and safe operation ability, which provides reliable psychological support for college students. The research shows that this system has an important application value in improving the precision and effectiveness of mental health services.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

art45;Scalable infrastructures for data in motion - Proceedings of the 14th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud, and Grid Computing. Analytics applications for reporting and human interaction with big data rely upon scalable frameworks for data ingest, storage, and computation. Batch processing of analytic workloads increases latency of results and can perform redundant computation. In real-world applications, new data points are continuously arriving and a suite of algorithms must be updated to reflect the changes. Reducing the latency of re-computation by keeping algorithms online and up-to-date enables fast query, experimentation, and drill-down. In this paper, we share our experiences designing and implementing scalable infrastructure around NoSQL databases for social media analytics applications. We propose a new heterogeneous architecture and execution model for streaming data applications that focuses on throughput and modularity.;art;" innovation actions aimed at improving the management of social interventions associated with the mission of the NPOs and the management of institutional projects.Research limitations/implications: The field work only used the survey technique to obtain the information and only assessed the perception of one of the directors of each of the NPOs participating in the study in terms of both the actions of organizational innovation such as social innovation and organizational performance. Therefore, the study undoubtedly presents bias in that perception. The technique used for the selection of the sample of the participants was a non-probabilistic sampling, which implies bias in the information and therefore, limitation for the generalization of the results to other contexts. The geographical location of the administration of the NPOs was restricted to Bogota and surrounding municipalities.Originality/value: An analysis of the relationship between social and organizational innovations with organizational performance in NPOs was carried out in the context of an emerging economy, where the subject has been very little studied and much less with principal component analysis.

We take a software-inspired viewpoint of clinical trial designs to design, develop and validate HealthSense to enable expressibility of complex ideas, composability with diverse devices and services while maximally maintaining simplicity for a clinical research user. A key innovation in HealthSense is the concept of a study state manager (SSM) that modifies parameters of the study over time as data accumulates and can trigger external events that affect the participant;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art48;The StoryPlaces Platform: Building a Web-Based Locative Hypertext System - Proceedings of the 29th on Hypertext and Social Media. Locative narrative systems have been a popular area of research for nearly two decades, but they are often bespoke systems, developed for particular deployments, or to demonstrate novel technologies. This has meant that they are short-lived, the narratives have been constructed by the creators of the system, and that the barrier to creating locative experiences has remained high due to a lack of common tools. We set out to create a platform based on the commonalities of these historic systems, with a focus on hypertext structure, and designed to enable locative based narratives to be created, deployed, and experienced in-the-wild. The result is StoryPlaces, an open source locative hypertext platform and authoring tool designed around a sculptural hypertext engine and built with existing Web technologies. As well as providing an open platform for future development, StoryPlaces also offers novelty in its management of location, including the separation of location and nodes, of descriptions from locations, and of content from pages, as well as being designed to have run-time caching and disconnection resilience. It also advances the state of the art in sculptural hypertext systems delivery through conditional functions, and nested, geographic and temporal conditions. The StoryPlaces platform has been used for the public deployment of over twenty locative narratives, and demonstrates the effectiveness of a general platform for delivering complex locative narrative experiences. In this paper we describe the process of creating the platform and our insights on the design of locative hypertext platforms.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art49;Lost and found: stopping bluetooth finders from leaking private information - Proceedings of the 13th ACM Conference on Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile Networks. A Bluetooth finder is a small battery-powered device that can be attached to important items such as bags, keychains, or bikes. The finder maintains a Bluetooth connection with the user's phone, and the user is notified immediately on connection loss. We provide the first comprehensive security and privacy analysis of current commercial Bluetooth finders. Our analysis reveals several significant security vulnerabilities in those products concerning mobile applications and the corresponding backend services in the cloud. We also show that all analyzed cloud-based products leak more private data than required for their respective cloud services.Overall, there is a big market for Bluetooth finders, but none of the existing products is privacy-friendly. We close this gap by designing and implementing PrivateFind, which ensures locations of the user are never leaked to third parties. It is designed to run on similar hardware as existing finders, allowing vendors to update their systems using PrivateFind.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

art51;Supporting micro-services deployment in a safer way: a static analysis and automated rewriting approach - Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing. The SOA ecosystem has drastically evolved since its childhood in the early 2000s. From monolithic services, micro-services now cooperate together in ultra-large scale systems. In this context, there is a tremendous need to deploy frequently new services, or new version of existing services. Container-based technologies (e.g., Docker) emerged recently to tool such deployments, promoting a black-box reuse mechanism to support off-the-shelf deployments. Unfortunately, from the service deployment point of view, such form of black-box reuse prevent to ensure what is really shipped inside the container with the service to deploy. In this paper, we propose a formalism to model and statically analyze service deployment artifacts based on state of the art deployment platforms. The static analysis mechanism leverages the hierarchy of deployment descriptors to verify a given deployment, as well as rewrite it to automatically fix common errors. The approach is validated through the automation of the guidelines provided by the user community associated to the reference Docker engine, and the analysis of 20,000 real deployment descriptors (hosted on GitHub).;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art52;Gelicit: A Cloud Platform for Distributed Gesture Elicitation Studies. A gesture elicitation study, as originally defined, consists of gathering a sample of participants in a room, instructing them to produce gestures they would use for a particular set of tasks, materialized through a representation called referent, and asking them to fill in a series of tests, questionnaires, and feedback forms. Until now, this procedure is conducted manually in a single, physical, and synchronous setup. To relax the constraints imposed by this manual procedure and to support stakeholders in defining and conducting such studies in multiple contexts of use, this paper presents Gelicit, a cloud computing platform that supports gesture elicitation studies distributed in time and space structured into six stages: (1) define a study: a designer defines a set of tasks with their referents for eliciting gestures and specifies an experimental protocol by parameterizing its settings;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

AI code generators like OpenAI Codex have the potential to assist novice programmers by generating code from natural language descriptions, however, over-reliance might negatively impact learning and retention. To explore the implications that AI code generators have on introductory programming, we conducted a controlled experiment with 69 novices (ages 10-17). Learners worked on 45 Python code-authoring tasks, for which half of the learners had access to Codex, each followed by a code-modification task. Our results show that using Codex significantly increased code-authoring performance (1.15x increased completion rate and 1.8x higher scores) while not decreasing performance on manual code-modification tasks. Additionally, learners with access to Codex during the training phase performed slightly better on the evaluation post-tests conducted one week later, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. Of interest, learners with higher Scratch pre-test scores performed significantly better on retention post-tests, if they had prior access to Codex.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art57;Designing Telepresence Drones to Support Synchronous, Mid-air Remote Collaboration: An Exploratory Study - Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. Drones are increasingly used to support humanitarian crises and events that involve dangerous or costly tasks. While drones have great potential for remote collaborative work and aerial telepresence, existing drone technology is limited in its support for synchronous collaboration among multiple remote users. Through three design iterations and evaluations, we prototyped Squadrone, a novel aerial telepresence platform that supports synchronous mid-air collaboration among multiple remote users. We present our design and report results from evaluating our iterations with 13 participants in 3 different collaboration configurations. Our first design iteration validates the basic functionality of the platform. Then, we establish the effectiveness of collaboration using a 360-degree shared aerial display. Finally, we simulate a type of search task in an open environment to see if collaborative telepresence impacts members‚Äô participation. The results validate some initial goals for Squadrone and are used to reflect back on a recent telepresence design framework.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

art68;"CSCW '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing. Welcome to CSCW 2017, the ACM 2017 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing! We are excited to welcome the CSCW community back to Portland, Oregon, where the second CSCW conference was held in 1988. Both Portland and CSCW have matured a great deal during the intervening 29 years. We hope that you will find that Portland provides a stimulating environment for our conference.CSCW is the premier venue for presenting research in the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks. Bringing together top researchers and practitioners from academia and industry, CSCW explores the technical, social, material, and theoretical challenges of designing technology to support collaborative work and life activities. CSCW welcomes a diverse range of topics and research methodologies. Studies often involve the development and application of novel technologies and/or ethnographic studies that inform design practice or theory. The mission of the conference is to share research that advances the state of human knowledge and improves both the design of systems and the ways they are used. The diversity of work in our conference program reflects the diversity of technology use in people's work, social, and civic lives as well as the geographic and cultural diversity of contributors.As many of you know, CSCW follows a rigorous ""revise and resubmit"" review process that uses peer review to improve submitted papers while maintaining a high-quality threshold for final acceptance. We also help prepare the next generation of reviewers with a mentorship program in which students review papers under the guidance of an experienced reviewer. This year we have the largest CSCW program ever. We had 530 submitted papers and 183 were accepted for presentation at the conference. The program also includes 4 papers published in ACM Transactions on Human- Computer Interaction (TOCHI). In addition, we will feature 14 workshops, 56 posters, 12 demos, and 3 panels.Lili Cheng of Microsoft Research will open the conference, speaking on ""Conversational AI &amp";art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art69;Salaxy: Enabling USB Debugging Mode Automatically to Control Android Devices. Android system attackers have proposed various attack schemes to invade users' privacy. One way is to use ADB (Android Debug Bridge) with advanced permissions but low protection. In order to set up an ADB connection successfully, the USB debugging option of the target device must be turned on. However, the existing ADB-based attack schemes have not proposed how to enable the USB debugging, so it couldn't be considered that their attack chain is completable. This paper presents an approach for attacking Android devices by exploiting JavaScript to enable USB debugging automatically in the device's system settings, which fills in the gaps of existing solutions. This method can bypass the security mechanism of USB debugging mode and obtain an ADB connection without the user's authorization. It can also bypass the alerts that ADB Action Monitor displays when sensitive behaviors are detected. Based on AccessibilityService, Auto.js and Scrcpy, an application called Salaxy is designed and implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. Besides, Salaxy can monitor and manipulate Android devices remotely.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art70;GitHubNet: Understanding the Characteristics of GitHub Network. Web 2.0 technologies have not only raised microblogs, but also social software development and collaboration platforms. GitHub is the most popular software development platform that provides social collaboration. Within the scope of this study, a novel graph-based analysis model is proposed which targets to reveal (1) the characteristics of the GitHub in order to shed light on social software development in general, and (2) the most popular programming languages, repositories, and developers in order to shed light on the trending software development technologies. To this end, a subset of the GitHub network, which contains 84, 737 developers and 209, 100 repositories, was collected through the GitHub API and stored on a graph database namely neo4j to be later analyzed. The result of the analysis shows that (1) the connections in GitHub are not mutually linked, (2) JavaScript, Python, and Java are currently the most popular three programming languages, (3) You-Dont-Know-JS, oh-my-zsh, and public-apis are the most popular three repositories, and (4) TarrySingh (Tarry Singh), indrajithbandara (Indrajith Bandara), and rootsongjc (Jimmy Song) are the most popular three developers. Furthermore, the proposed novel analysis model can be easily applied to other social networks.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art71;Servitization of Customized 3D Assets and Performance Comparison of Services and Microservices Implementations. 3D models (or assets) that are present in many of modern software applications are first modeled by graphic designers using dedicated computer graphic tools and then integrated into such software applications or apps by software developers. This simple workflow/procedure requires developers to have a basic grounding in computer graphics, since 3D engines, libraries and third-party software are needed for this kind of integrations. Oftentimes, 3D designers are also required to customize or produce versions of a 3D model and thus, they must re-model all the assets before they are returned back to the developers for integration into the applications. This procedure also occurs whenever a modification or customization is requested. One possible significant improvement to this traditional, poorly automated workflow is to use services-oriented technology and features servitization to carry out the customization of 3D assets on-demand. In this article, we introduce $ \mu $ŒºS3D, an open-source microservices-based platform designed to support features relating to the customization of 3D models. $ \mu $ŒºS3D not only enables 3D assets to be customized without the need for computer graphic tools or designers, but also allows 3D models to be visualized through web technologies (e.g., HTML, Javascript and web component to visualize and interact with 3D models), thereby avoiding the development of computer graphics libraries or components in final software products. The article describes the elements that $ \mu $ŒºS3D comprises, explains how it works and presents a series of load tests to compare the performance (time consumption, CPU and memory utilization) of $ \mu $ŒºS3D when implemented and deployed as a microservices platform against a monolithic-based implementation, showing similar results with a low number of users (and requests) but reducing, on average, 64.32% the response time in the microservice-based implementation for a large number of users;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art72;An Empirical Study of Greedy Test Suite Minimization Techniques Using Mutation Coverage. Test suite minimization is the task of finding a smaller test suite that still fulfills the properties of the original test suite but which comprises fewer test cases. It is important in practice, especially in the context of regression testing, where test suites are re-executed. However, test suite minimization as a set covering problem is known as an NP-complete problem, which requires applications of heuristics. Although many test suite minimization techniques have been applied previously but obtained conflicting results primarily due to inherent differences in underlying programming languages and experimental setup. In this respect, we study traditional greedy-based algorithms for test suite minimization that allow to remove test cases in a way such that the reduced test suite satisfies all requirements. Specifically, we evaluated commonly discussed approaches on publicly available JavaScript applications using mutation coverage. We show that the discussed algorithms reduce the test suite size of the studied example programs on average to 70% without compromising the fault-detection capability of the original test suite. The suggested approach not only minimizes the test suite‚Äôs size, thereby reducing the regression testing cost, but also ensures that the reduced test suite catches the same number of faults as that of the original test suite. Further, we also examine their performance in scenarios when meeting all testing requirements is not feasible due to time and budget constraints.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art73;ProvenanceWidgets: A Library of UI Control Elements to Track and Dynamically Overlay Analytic Provenance. We present ProvenanceWidgets, a Javascript library of UI control elements such as radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdowns to track and dynamically overlay a user's analytic provenance. These in situ overlays not only save screen space but also minimize the amount of time and effort needed to access the same information from elsewhere in the UI. In this paper, we discuss how we design modular UI control elements to track how often and how recently a user interacts with them and design visual overlays showing an aggregated summary as well as a detailed temporal history. We demonstrate the capability of ProvenanceWidgets by recreating three prior widget libraries: (1) Scented Widgets, (2) Phosphor objects, and (3) Dynamic Query Widgets. We also evaluated its expressiveness and conducted case studies with visualization developers to evaluate its effectiveness. We find that ProvenanceWidgets enables developers to implement custom provenance-tracking applications effectively. ProvenanceWidgets is available as open-source software at https://github.com/ProvenanceWidgets to help application developers build custom provenance-based systems.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art74;Client Puzzle Protocols as Countermeasure Against Automated Threats to Web Applications. Proof-of-work (PoW) schemes implemented in client puzzle protocols (CPPs) have been proposed as a protection from Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks against internet facing servers. A CPP designed to thwart attacks against a certain client-server protocol is layered independently on top of this protocol or is integrated into it. Such a general solution requires a great deal of standardization. On the other hand, different web applications that may also become targets of DoS attacks can be protected by different schemes, which greatly reduces standardization requirements and makes implementations substantially easier. In the present study, we discuss the utility of CPPs as a practical layer of protection of web applications against DoS and other automated threat events. We define several requirements that must be met by such CPPs, and we propose a general concept and a particular PoW algorithm that fulfills these requirements. The general concept includes recursive definition of sub-puzzles and partial server-side solution verification. The proposed PoW algorithm is based on this concept and on hash inversion/collision tasks. We also introduce a few prototype implementations of this algorithm in JavaScript, WebAssembly, Python, and C, and we present the results of some benchmark tests comparing the performances of these implementations on different hardware. These results show that CPPs can provide an effective layer of mitigation against certain automated threats to web applications.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art75;Disclosure: Improving Performance and Security of Web App Migration in Liquid Computing. Web app migration refers to capturing a snapshot of the execution state of a web app on a device and restoring it on another device to continue its execution for cross-device liquid computing. Although web apps are relatively easy to migrate due to their high portability, there is a JavaScript language feature called closure that complicates the migration since it requires migrating the variable states of already-finished outer functions. One approach to web app migration is to instrument the source code to trace the closure variables, yet this often suffers from performance slowdown, especially for multiple migrations. In this paper, we propose a new instrumentation-based technique called Disclosure, which moves the declarations of closure variables to a managed data structure and replaces the closure variables with the corresponding references to the data structure. This technique can improve runtime performance while enhancing security. We evaluated our work with eight Octane benchmarks and four real web apps. The runtime performance penalty due to Disclosure is 0‚Äì15%, which is a significant improvement over the results of the latest instrumentation-based work that supports similar deep closures and multiple migrations to Disclosure. Furthermore, real web apps are demonstrated to migrate seamlessly, even multiple times. Finally, Disclosure can hide data from exposure during migration with a secure migration technique using data encryption.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art76;The Effects of Computational Resources on Flaky Tests. Flaky tests are tests that non-deterministically pass and fail in unchanged code. These tests can be detrimental to developers‚Äô productivity. Particularly when tests run in continuous integration environments, the tests may be competing for access to limited computational resources (CPUs, memory etc.), and we hypothesize that resource (un)-availability may be a significant factor in the failure rate of flaky tests. We present the first assessment of the impact that computational resources have on flaky tests, including a total of 52 projects written in Java, JavaScript and Python, and 27 different resource configurations. Using a rigorous statistical methodology, we determine which tests are RAFTs (Resource-Affected Flaky Tests). We find that 46.5% of the flaky tests in our dataset are RAFTs, indicating that a substantial proportion of flaky-test failures happen depending on the resources available when running tests. We report RAFTs and configurations to avoid them to developers, and received interest to either fix the RAFTs or to improve the specifications of the projects so that tests would be run only in configurations that are unlikely to encounter RAFT failures. Although most test suites in our dataset are executed quite quickly (under one minute) in a baseline configuration, our results highlight the possibility of using this methodology to detect RAFT to reduce the cost of cloud infrastructure for reliably running larger test suites.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art77;GenDE: A CRF-Based Data Extractor. Web site schema detection and data extraction from the Deep Web have been studied a lot. Although, few researches have focused on the more challenging jobs: wrapper verification or extractor generation. A wrapper verifier would check whether a new page from a site complies with the detected schema, and so the extractor will use the wrapper to get instances of the schema types. If the wrapper failed to work with the new page, a new wrapper/schema would be re-generated by calling an unsupervised wrapper induction system. In this paper, a new data extractor called GenDE is proposed. It verifies the site schema and extracts data from the Web pages using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). The problem is solved by breaking down an observation sequence (a Web page) into simpler subsequences that will be labeled using CRF. Moreover, the system solves the problem of automatic data extraction from modern JavaScript sites in which data/schema are attached (on the client side) in a JSON format. The experiments show an encouraging result as it outperforms the CSP-based extractor algorithm (95% and 96% of recall and precision, respectively). Moreover, it gives a high performance result when tested on the SWDE benchmark dataset (84.91%).;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art78;Understanding Flaky Tests Through Linguistic Diversity: A Cross-Language and Comparative Machine Learning Study. Software development is significantly impeded by flaky tests, which intermittently pass or fail without requiring code modifications, resulting in a decline in confidence in automated testing frameworks. Code smells (i.e., test case or production code) are the primary cause of test flakiness. In order to ascertain the prevalence of test smells, researchers and practitioners have examined numerous programming languages. However, one isolated experiment was conducted, which focused solely on one programming language. Across a variety of programming languages, such as Java, Python, C++, Go, and JavaScript, this study examines the predictive accuracy of a variety of machine learning classifiers in identifying flaky tests. We compare the performance of classifiers such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression in both single-language and cross-language settings. In order to ascertain the impact of linguistic diversity on the flakiness of test cases, models were trained on a single language and subsequently tested on a variety of languages. The following key findings indicate that Random Forest and Logistic Regression consistently outperform other classifiers in terms of accuracy, adaptability, and generalizability, particularly in cross-language environments. Additionally, the investigation contrasts our findings with those of previous research, exhibiting enhanced precision and accuracy in the identification of flaky tests as a result of meticulous classifier selection. We conducted a thorough statistical analysis, which included t-tests, to assess the importance of classifier performance differences in terms of accuracy and F1-score across a variety of programming languages. This analysis emphasizes the substantial discrepancies between classifiers and their effectiveness in detecting flaky tests. The datasets and experiment code utilized in this study are accessible through an open source GitHub repository to facilitate reproducibility is available at: https://github.com/PELAB-LiU/FlakyCrossLanguage. Our results emphasize the effectiveness of probabilistic and ensemble classifiers in improving the reliability of automated testing, despite certain constraints, including the potential biases introduced by language-specific structures and dataset variability. This research provides developers and researchers with practical insights that can be applied to the mitigation of flaky tests in a variety of software environments.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art79;VMetaFlow: A Meta-Framework for Integrating Visualizations in Coordinated View Applications. The analysis and exploration of complex data sets are common problems in many areas, including scientific and business domains. This need has led to substantial development of the data visualization field. In this paper, we present VMetaFlow, a graphical meta-framework to design interactive and coordinated views applications for data visualization. Our meta-framework is based on data flow diagrams since they have proved their value in simplifying the design of data visualizations. VMetaFlow operates as an abstraction layer that encapsulates and interconnects visualization frameworks in a web-based environment, providing them with interoperability mechanisms. The only requirement is that the visualization framework must be accessible through a JavaScript API. We propose a novel data flow model that allows users to define both interactions between multiple data views and how the data flows between visualization and data processing modules. In contrast with previous data-flow-based frameworks for visualization, we separate the view interactions from data items, broadening the expressiveness of our model and supporting the most common types of multi-view interactions. Our meta-framework allows visualization and data analysis experts to focus their efforts on creating data representations and transformations for their applications, whereas nonexperts can reuse previously developed components to design their applications through a user-friendly interface. We validate our approach through a critical inspection with visualization experts and two case studies. We have carefully selected these case studies to illustrate its capabilities. Finally, we compare our approach with the subset flow model designed for multiple coordinated views.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art80;On the Impact of Refactorings on Software Attack Surface. Refactoring is one of the techniques mostly employed by software developers to improve the quality attributes of their systems. However, little has been done to investigate how refactoring operations specifically aimed at improving the internal structure of software can impact its security. Refactoring usually entails different code change operations including the decomposition of classes, methods, and the reallocation of code elements. While this refinement aims to improve the internal design of a system, it might inadvertently disperse security-critical code elements throughout the codebase. Consequently, such dispersion could affect the software attack surface. To this end, this paper presents an empirical study conducted on 30 open-source software systems that were developed in Python, C, and Javascript. The study scrutinized two subsequent versions of each subject application to uncover the refactoring operations applied and the trend of the software attack surface. Specifically, the study focused on the injection or removal of bugs, code smells and other vulnerabilities aiming to discern the impact of refactorings on the software attack surface. Data was collected using well-known tools, namely SonarQube, RefDiff, and PyReff. The findings suggest that refactorings can have multiple impacts (i.e., positive, negative, or neutral) on bugs, code smells, and vulnerabilities. The findings further confirm that developers must be aware of the combination or sequence of refactoring operations that can improve software quality without compromising its security.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art81;Adaptive Redistribution and Replication to Improve the Responsiveness of Mobile Web Apps. In a mobile web app, a browser-based client communicates with a cloud-based server across the network. An app is statically divided into client and server functionalities, so the resulting division remains fixed at runtime. However, if such static division mismatches the current network conditions and the device's processing capacities, app responsiveness and energy efficiency can deteriorate rapidly. To address this problem, we present Communicating Web Vessels (CWV), an adaptive redistribution and replication framework that improves the responsiveness of full-stack JavaScript mobile apps. Unlike standard computation offloading, in which client functionalities move to run on the server, CWV's redistribution is bidirectional. Without any preprocessing, CWV enables apps to move any functionality from the server to the client and vice versa at runtime, thus adapting to the ever-changing execution environment of the web. Having moved to the client, former server functionalities become regular local functions. To further improve performance, CWV can replicate server-side functionalities on the client and keep the replicas consistent. By monitoring the network, CWV determines if a redistribution or a replication would improve app performance, and then analyzes, transforms, sandboxes, moves, or replicates functions and program state at runtime. An evaluation with third-party mobile web apps shows that CWV optimizes their performance for dissimilar network conditions and client devices. As compared to their original versions, CWV-powered web apps improve their performance (i.e., latency, energy consumption), particularly when executed over limited networks. 11This article is a revised and extended version of our prior paper, published in the 21st International Conference on Web Engineering (ICWE 2021) [9].;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art82;G-CoV.2: A computational system for geolocation of patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory infection caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). In the current scenario of COVID-19, more than 6 million people have died worldwide, and near seven hundred thousand only in Brazil alone. The objective this work is designer a database using MySQL to develop a system for geolocating COVID-19 affected individuals and their close contacts. Patient addresses registered in the laboratory database were used to search for coordinate (latitude and longitude) using the OpenStreetMap Application Programming Interface. The user interface was developed in PHP using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and AJAX. A dashboard displaying the geolocation information of selected patients was presented on the screen for public health agents. A system called G-CoV.2 was developed. The makers produced by G-CoV.2 had 100% accuracy when manually compared with the same patient address records. G-CoV.2 can be used as a computational system to aid health managers in identifying regions with the most people infected by COVID-19 or other pathological processes. The submitted work can meet the third goal of sustainable development of the United Nations for Latin America, ensuring a healthy life and thus promoting well-being for all people, at all ages. One of the ways is through the monitoring of COVID-19 and other pathologies as a preventive measure, applying the system developed G-CoV.2 that was the subject of the writing of the article, which may reduce the mortality rate at all ages, with the premise of ending epidemics of serious and communicable diseases, directing health managers to increase investment in health in critical areas, as well as creating actions in favor of prevention and promotion of the population's health.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art83;JavaScript Performance Tuning as a Crowdsourced Service. JavaScript (JS) is one of the most used programming languages for mobile applications. As JS is increasingly used in computation-intensive and latency-sensitive components, JS application performance can significantly impact user experience. While compilers play a crucial role in optimizing JS performance on mobile systems, their optimizations must be simple due to the computation and battery usage limitations of the underlying hardware platforms. We present JSTuner, a machine-learning system to leverage compiler-based autotuning techniques to optimize JS performance by finding a good compiler optimization sequence. JSTuner is designed to reduce the cost of autotuning by using prior knowledge of JS programs collected through a crowdsourcing framework to bootstrap the search process. It allows the user to seamlessly utilize the computation resources of a cloud server to perform the heavy-lifting autotuning process for repeatedly running JS components. This enables aggressive search-based optimizations that are too expensive to run on the user's device. We evaluate JSTuner by applying it to 60 JS benchmarks across three distinct mobile devices and comparing it against four search-based techniques. Experimental results show that JSTuner consistently outperforms prior techniques and improves JS performance by 1.62x on average (up to 3.33x) over the default compiler setting used by the Chrome V8 JS engine.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art84;Comprehensive Fine-Tuning Large Language Models of Code for Automated Program Repair. Automated program repair (APR) research has entered the era of large language models (LLM), and researchers have conducted several empirical studies to explore the repair capabilities of LLMs for APR. Many studies adopt the zero/few-shot learning paradigm for APR, which directly use LLMs to generate the possibly correct code given its surrounding context. Though effective, the repair capabilities of LLMs based on the fine-tuning paradigm have yet to be extensively explored. Also, it remains unknown whether LLMs have the potential to repair more complicated bugs (e.g., multi-hunk bugs). To fill the gap, in the conference version of this work, we conduct an initial study on the program repair capability of million-level LLMs in the fine-tuning paradigm. We¬†select 5 popular million-level LLMs with representative pre-training architectures, including CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, PLBART, CodeT5, and UniXcoder. We¬†consider 3 typical program repair scenarios (i.e., bugs, vulnerabilities, and errors) involving 3 programming languages (i.e., Java, C/C++, and JavaScript). Our experimental results show that fine-tuning these LLMs can significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art APR tools. However, the repair capabilities of billion-level LLMs for APR remain largely unexplored. Moreover, their substantial model sizes significantly increase the computational cost of fine-tuning. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques offer a promising solution, their effectiveness in repair tasks and the selection of appropriate PEFT strategies remain unclear. Similarly, many novel APR strategies have been developed for non-pre-trained models, yet their applicability and effectiveness on LLMs are still unexamined. To address these gaps, we extend our prior study through three key dimensions: 1) LLM4APR, which evaluates the repair capabilities of five billion-level LLM families (InCoder, CodeGeeX, CodeGen, StarCoder, and CodeLlama) under the fine-tuning paradigm;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art85;Power- and Memory-Efficient Low-Cost IoT Sensing System for Biodiversity Surveillance Developed on Resource-Constrained Platform. Imperative demand is arising for biodiversity surveillance due to the decline in certain insect species. Existing biodiversity surveillance systems depend on high-end processors and heavy operating systems (OSs) that require numerous packages, resulting in increasing complexity and power consumption. In contrast, resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) platforms are cheap and require minimal code footprints for operation, resulting in reduced complexity. However, due to the resource scarcity of such platforms, it is required to integrate efficient management strategies for handling a large volume of data generated by the surveillance system. To address this, a low-cost sensing system on a resource-constrained platform is developed that offers power-efficient biodiversity monitoring through a proposed task-scheduling architecture. The system employs the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol for the publish-subscribe paradigm. However, the existing JavaScript object notation (JSON)-based MQTT payload format limits the payload size for transmission and increases random access memory (RAM) utilization. To overcome this issue, a raw binary MQTT transmission pipeline is proposed which maximizes the payload size while reducing RAM usage and transmission time, leading to lower energy consumption compared to JSON-based transmission. Furthermore, the proposed over-the-air (OTA) update framework enables remote updates to system configurations. Graphical and tabular comparisons of current consumption, battery lifetime, and cost demonstrate that the designed sensing system outperforms the existing DarkNet53, PICT, and Moth traps systems. Moreover, the presented cloud pipeline architecture provides insect species inferences with an approximate precision of 97%.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art86;Timing and Speculative Execution Attacks: Defeating State-of-the-Art Code-Reuse Defenses. Recently, numerous effective defensive strategies like ASLR and execute-no-read have been put forward to counter code-reuse attacks in software systems. These methods safeguard systems robustly by addressing randomization or memory access constraints. However, this paper uncovers a novel vulnerability in these approaches: the lack of time protection. We present a new assault method named the timing function attack. This attack can successful initiate a code-reuse attack although the presence of state-of-the-art defensives. By exploiting the time channel, we can obtain crucial security information despite previous attempts to hide spatial details. Specifically, we use function execution time for side-channel attacks, de-randomize code segment layouts and then execute a code-reuse attack. To verify its practicality, we conduct attacks on ChakraCore and Chrome v8 JavaScript engines. Results show it can bypass defenses like function-granularity ASLR and XnR, escalating privileges. We also introduce SAROP, which uses speculative execution vulnerabilities to bypass address randomization. We compare these two attacks and discuss defense mechanisms, emphasizing the need for multi-layered security.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art87;Low-Cost Image and Video Processing Using High-Performance Middleware in Single-board Computers with Open Internet Standards. Image processing is becoming ubiquitous in many activities. This kind of systems use industry-standard libraries, such as OpenCV, and GPGPU techniques such as CUDA and OpenCL. Nowadays, these are being ported to many computing platforms, offering significant processing power even in devices with limited resources. However, the only model that is truly ubiquitous, is the web itself. Modern browsers feature quite complex internals and offer sophisticated development and profiling tools, in order to offer the best user experience. Introduction of HTML5 allows Realtime video and image manipulation, in browser space, without any plugin. In addition, Wasm (web assembly) Javascript execution engine provides fastest possible performance by means of highly customized compiler and runtime, in almost any browser, including embedded ones. This paper presents an image processing system, architected as a modular web application, using only Raspberry PIs with a compact but fast middleware server, that performs all image operations in browser space by means of web assemblies. All components, including database support, can run in a single board, providing image and video processing speeds that match, or surpass, their native compiled C counterparts on the same platform. This solution has a very low cost, that fits with emerging markets, making it ideal for LATAM scenarios.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art88;Compressing Multisets With Large Alphabets. Current methods which compress multisets at an optimal rate have computational complexity that scales linearly with alphabet size, making them too slow to be practical in many real-world settings. We show how to convert a compression algorithm for sequences into one for multisets, in exchange for an additional complexity term that is quasi-linear in sequence length. This allows us to compress multisets of exchangeable symbols at an optimal rate, with computational complexity decoupled from the alphabet size. The key insight is to avoid encoding the multiset directly, and instead compress a proxy sequence, using a technique called ‚Äòbits-back coding‚Äô. We demonstrate the method experimentally on tasks which are intractable with previous optimal-rate methods: compression of multisets of images and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files. Code for our experiments is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/multiset-compression.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art89;Improving OSNMAlib: New Formats, Features, and Monitoring Capabilities. Galileo will declare Open Service Navigation Message Authentication (OSNMA), a civil Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal authentication scheme, operational in the near future. OSNMAlib, an open-source library that implements OSNMA, was presented two years ago after the test phase of the protocol started and has since undergone several upgrades. In this article, we disclose these upgrades, which comprise new input sources, new features and optimizations, and the creation of an OSNMA real-time monitoring website. For each input source, we describe how can they be integrated within an OSNMA library and what pitfalls to avoid. The new features include optimizations for data retrieval such as the use of dual frequency and Reed-Solomon encoding, which are evaluated in urban and open sky scenarios using real recorded data. The new JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) logging format aimed at researchers is used in osnmalib.eu website to display, in a friendly and understandable way, the live Galileo and OSNMA messages and the OSNMAlib authentication output. In addition, the website also provides the I/NAV data bits to help snapshot receivers and other GNSS-based applications.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art90;3D Web Application of Wind Prediction Under Typhoon on Coastal Cities Based on Ensemble k-NN and OpenFOAM. Coastal cities are vulnerable areas to the impacts of strong wind under typhoon events. To anticipate the impact, this study proposes a novel approach to integrate the typhoon track predictions generated by an ensemble k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) as the reference locations of the typhoon center. The global weather forecast data corrected using an ensemble k-NN-based typhoon track was transferred to the OpenFOAM model simulation to obtain the urban-scale wind with multiple obstacles. The Gwangan Bridge, which faces the East Sea and is one of the sites in Busan City used in this study, is used for evaluating the approach with three typhoon events, i.e. Nari in 2007, Chaba in 2016, and Cimaron in 2018. The simulation results are disseminated in a 3D web application framework using Node JS for the web framework, PostgreSQL and PostGIS for database management, and CesiumJS for the main JavaScript library of 3D visualization. The study results show that this approach can performed well when compared with observed data from the wind station on the bridge, with correlation coefficient, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.902, 1.505, and 1.927, respectively. The adjustment of grid positions through an ensemble k-NN-based typhoon prediction model on the global weather forecast data for OpenFOAM input significantly contributes to the accuracy of urban-scale wind prediction. This study also produces a more sophisticated web-based virtual globe and 3D city model to demonstrate a current typhoon prediction and past typhoons, online simulation results of ensemble k-NN algorithm, a volumetric profile of typhoons, wind flow, streamlines, wind pressure around buildings and a bridge, warning status, and time series of predicted wind velocity for supporting the disaster early warning system.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art91;A General Framework for Comparing Embedding Visualizations Across Class-Label Hierarchies. Projecting high-dimensional vectors into two dimensions for visualization, known as embedding visualization, facilitates perceptual reasoning and interpretation. Comparing multiple embedding visualizations drives decision-making in many domains, but traditional comparison methods are limited by a reliance on direct point correspondences. This requirement precludes comparisons without point correspondences, such as two different datasets of annotated images, and fails to capture meaningful higher-level relationships among point groups. To address these shortcomings, we propose a general framework for comparing embedding visualizations based on shared class labels rather than individual points. Our approach partitions points into regions corresponding to three key class concepts-confusion, neighborhood, and relative size-to characterize intra- and inter-class relationships. Informed by a preliminary user study, we implemented our framework using perceptual neighborhood graphs to define these regions and introduced metrics to quantify each concept. We demonstrate the generality of our framework with usage scenarios from machine learning and single-cell biology, highlighting our metrics' ability to draw insightful comparisons across label hierarchies. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted an evaluation study with five machine learning researchers and six single-cell biologists using an interactive and scalable prototype built with Python, JavaScript, and Rust. Our metrics enable more structured comparisons through visual guidance and increased participants' confidence in their findings.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

art93;A Model-Driven Approach to Generate Schemas for Object-Document Mappers. Many actual NoSQL systems are schemaless, that is, the structure of the data is not defined beforehand in any schema, but it is implicit in the data itself. This characteristic is very convenient when the data structure suffers frequent changes. However, the agility and flexibility achieved is at the cost of losing some important benefits, such as 1) assuring that the data stored and retrieved fits the database schema;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art94;Leveraging WebAssembly for Numerical JavaScript Code Virtualization. Code obfuscation built upon code virtualization technology is one of the viable means for protecting sensitive algorithms and data against code reverse engineering attacks. Code virtualization has been successfully applied to programming languages like C, C++, and Java. However, it remains an outstanding challenge to apply this promising technique to JavaScript, a popular web programming language. This is primarily due to the open visibility of JavaScript code and the expensive runtime overhead associated with code virtualization. This paper presents JSPro, a novel code virtualization system for JavaScript. JSPro is the first JavaScript code obfuscation tool that builds upon the emerging WebAssembly language standard. It is designed to provide more secure code protection but without incurring a significant runtime penalty, explicitly targeting numerical JavaScript kernels. We achieve this by first automatically translating the target JavaScript code into WebAssembly and then performing code obfuscation on the compiled WebAssembly binary. Our design has two advantages over existing solutions: (1) it increases the code reverse entering complexity by implementing code obfuscation at a lower binary level and (2) it significantly reduces the performance impact of code virtualization over the native JavaScript code by using the performance-tuned WebAssembly language. We evaluate JSPro on a set of numerical JavaScript algorithms widely used in many applications. To test the performance, we apply JSPro to four mainstream web browsers running on three distinct mobile devices. Compared to state-of-the-art JavaScript obfuscation tools, JSPro not only provides stronger protection but also reduces the runtime overhead by at least 15% (up to 38.2%) and the code size by 28.2% on average.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art95;Segment-Based Multiple-Base Compressed Addressing for Flexible JavaScript Heap Allocation. Many Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems use lightweight JavaScript engines to support easy programming in microcontrollers. Lightweight JavaScript engines use several techniques for memory optimization, such as static heap reservation and compressed addressing. Recent IoT systems also use several external libraries and a larger on-chip memory to support abundant functionalities, such as machine learning and connectivity. However, as the JavaScript heap space is not resizable owing to the memory optimizations, the JavaScript engine or an external library is prone to fail the memory allocation in these devices. To address this problem, we propose a flexible memory optimization technique, segment-based multiple-base compressed addressing (SMBCA), which compresses a pointer indicating a JavaScript object allocated to a resizable heap based on multiple base addresses. SMBCA comprises two components: a dynamic segment allocator (DSA) and a multiple-base compressed address translator (MBCAT). DSA dynamically allocates the JavaScript heap in segment units. Meanwhile, MBCAT converts a low-bitwidth address into a full-bitwidth address and vice versa, based on the multiple base addresses. To reduce the address compression overhead of MBCAT, we propose a software cache technique, reverse map cache (RMC). We found that the SMBCA reduces average memory usage by 43.9% compared to the existing lightweight JavaScript engines when running SunSpider benchmarks, V8 benchmarks, and real-world applications. We also showed that the RMC reduces the average address compression latency of MBCAT by 34.9% when running the SunSpider benchmarks.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art96;Understanding JavaScript Vulnerabilities in Large Real-World Android Applications. JavaScript-related vulnerabilities are becoming a major security threat to hybrid mobile applications. In this article, we present a systematic study to understand how JavaScript is used in real-world Android apps and how it may lead to security vulnerabilities. We begin by conducting an empirical study on the top-100 most popular Android apps to investigate JavaScript usage and its related security vulnerabilities. Our study identifies four categories of JavaScript usage and finds that three of these categories, if inappropriately used, can respectively lead to three types of vulnerabilities. We also design and implement an automatic tool named JSDroid to detect JavaScript-related vulnerabilities. We have applied JSDroid to 1,000 large real-world Android apps and found that over 70 percent of these apps have potential JavaScript-related vulnerabilities and 20 percent of them can be successfully exploited. Moreover, based on the vulnerabilities identified by JSDroid, we have successfully launched real attacks on 30 real-world apps.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art97;JavaScript Dead Code Identification, Elimination, and Empirical Assessment. Web apps are built by using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While building modern web apps, it is common practice to make use of third-party libraries and frameworks, as to improve developers‚Äô productivity and code quality. Alongside these benefits, the adoption of such libraries results in the introduction of JavaScript dead code, i.e., code implementing unused functionalities. The costs for downloading and parsing dead code can negatively contribute to the loading time and resource usage of web apps. The goal of our study is two-fold. First, we present Lacuna, an approach for automatically detecting and eliminating JavaScript dead code from web apps. The proposed approach supports both static and dynamic analyses, it is extensible and can be applied to any JavaScript code base, without imposing constraints on the coding style or on the use of specific JavaScript constructs. Second, by leveraging Lacuna we conduct an experiment to empirically evaluate the run-time overhead of JavaScript dead code in terms of energy consumption, performance, network usage, and resource usage in the context of mobile web apps. We applied Lacuna four times on 30 mobile web apps independently developed by third-party developers, each time eliminating dead code according to a different optimization level provided by Lacuna. Afterward, each different version of the web app is executed on an Android device, while collecting measures to assess the potential run-time overhead caused by dead code. Experimental results, among others, highlight that the removal of JavaScript dead code has a positive impact on the loading time of mobile web apps, while significantly reducing the number of bytes transferred over the network.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art98;The Adoption of JavaScript Linters in Practice: A Case Study on ESLint. A linter is a static analysis tool that warns software developers about possible code errors or violations to coding standards. By using such a tool, errors can be surfaced early in the development process when they are cheaper to fix. For a linter to be successful, it is important to understand the needs and challenges of developers when using a linter. In this paper, we examine developers‚Äô perceptions on JavaScript linters. We study why and how developers use linters along with the challenges they face while using such tools. For this purpose we perform a case study on ESLint, the most popular JavaScript linter. We collect data with three different methods where we interviewed 15 developers from well-known open source projects, analyzed over 9,500 ESLint configuration files, and surveyed 337 developers from the JavaScript community. Our results provide practitioners with reasons for using linters in their JavaScript projects as well as several configuration strategies and their advantages. We also provide a list of linter rules that are often enabled and disabled, which can be interpreted as the most important rules to reason about when configuring linters. Finally, we propose several feature suggestions for tool makers and future work for researchers.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art99;On the Untriviality of Trivial Packages: An Empirical Study of npm JavaScript Packages. Nowadays, developing software would be unthinkable without the use of third-party packages. Although such code reuse helps to achieve rapid continuous delivery of software to end-users, blindly reusing code has its pitfalls. For example, prior work has investigated the rationale for using packages that implement simple functionalities, known as trivial packages (i.e., in terms of the code size and complexity). This prior work showed that although these trivial packages were simple, they were popular and prevalent in the npm ecosystem. This popularity and prevalence of trivial packages peaked our interest in questioning the ‚Äòtriviality of trivial packages‚Äô. To better understand and examine the triviality of trivial packages, we mine a large set of JavaScript projects that use trivial npm packages and evaluate their relative centrality. Specifically, we evaluate the triviality from two complementary points of view: based on project usage and ecosystem usage of these trivial packages. Our result shows that trivial packages are being used in central JavaScript files of a software project. Additionally, by analyzing all external package API calls in these JavaScript files, we found that a high percentage of these API calls are attributed to trivial packages. Therefore, these packages play a significant role in JavaScript files. Furthermore, in the package dependency network, we observed that 16.8 percent packages are trivial and in some cases removing a trivial package can impact approximately 29 percent of the ecosystem. Overall, our finding indicates that although smaller in size and complexity, trivial packages are highly depended on packages by JavaScript projects. Additionally, our study shows that although they might be called trivial, nothing about trivial packages is trivial.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art100;Evolving JavaScript Code to Reduce Load Time. JavaScript is one of the most used programming languages for front-end development of Web applications. The increase in complexity of front-end features brings concerns about performance, especially the load and execution time of JavaScript code. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary program improvement technique to reduce the size of JavaScript programs and, therefore, the time required to load and execute them in Web applications. To guide the development of this technique, we performed an experimental study to characterize the patches applied to JavaScript programs to reduce their size while keeping the functionality required to pass all test cases in their test suites. We applied this technique to 19 JavaScript programs varying from 92 to 15,602 LOC and observed reductions from 0.2 to 73.8 percent of the original code, as well as a relationship between the quality of a program's test suite and the ability to reduce the size of its source code.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art101;GenProgJS: A Baseline System for Test-Based Automated Repair of JavaScript Programs. Originally, GenProg was created to repair buggy programs written in the C programming language, launching a new discipline in Generate-and-Validate approach of Automated Program Repair (APR). Since then, a number of other tools has been published using a variety of repair approaches. Some of these still operate on programs written in C/C++, others on Java or even Python programs. In this work, a tool named GenProgJS is presented, which generates candidate patches for faulty JavaScript programs. The algorithm it uses is very similar to the genetic algorithm used in the original GenProg, hence the name. In addition to the traditional approach, solutions used in some more recent works were also incorporated, and JavaScript language-specific approaches were also taken into account when the tool was designed. To the best of our knowledge, the tool presented here is the first to apply GenProg's general generate-and-validate approach to JavaScript programs. We evaluate the method on the BugsJS bug database, where it successfully fixed 31 bugs in 6 open source Node.js projects. These bugs belong to 14 different categories showing the generic nature of the method. During the experiments, code transformations applied on the original source code are all traced, and an in-depth analysis of mutation operators and fine-grained changes are also presented. We share our findings with the APR research community and describe the difficulties and differences we faced while designed this JavaScript repair tool. The source code of GenProgJS is publicly available on Github, with a pre-configured Docker environment where it can easily be launched.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art102;Tail Call Optimization Tailored for Native Stack Utilization in JavaScript Runtimes. JavaScript has significantly evolved, broadening its capabilities. However, the uptake of tail call optimization (TCO) remains limited, largely due to concerns about debugging difficulties and the potential increase in overall complexity. This paper highlights the compelling importance of tail calls within web applications, advocating for TCO as a means to boost performance and enhance memory efficiency. We present an innovative TCO technique that leverages the native stack within JavaScript engines, capitalizing on the native stack‚Äôs inherent benefits over heap memory. This technique is carefully crafted to comply with diverse TCO standards, prioritizing simplicity and providing debugging features. We tackle the inherent challenges of TCO and successfully deploy our method in a lightweight JavaScript engine. Our approach is rigorously evaluated, proving its effectiveness and practicality. Notably, our implementation facilitates considerable memory savings for web applications, comparable to the maximum Resident Set Size (RSS), and achieves an average performance improvement of approximately 19.8% for algorithms that are heavily recursive. This research not only demonstrates the versatility and efficiency of our TCO strategy but also makes a significant contribution to the wider adoption and comprehension of TCO, thereby improving JavaScript engines‚Äô performance and memory management efficiency.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art103;Optimal Allocation of TCSC Devices in Transmission Power Systems by a Novel Adaptive Dwarf Mongoose Optimization. This paper introduces a novel Improved Dwarf Mongoose Optimizer (IDMO) based on an Alpha-Directed Learning Process (ADLP) for dealing with different mathematical benchmark models and engineering problems. The dwarf mongoose‚Äôs foraging behavior motivated the DMO‚Äôs primary design. Three social groupings are used: the alpha group, babysitters, and scouts. The unique suggested solution includes an upgraded ADLP to boost searching abilities, and its upgrading mechanism is substantially led by the improved alpha. First, the IDMO and DMO are put through their paces using CEC 2017 single objective optimization benchmarks. Also, several recent optimization techniques are taken into contrast, including artificial ecosystem optimization (AEO), aquila optimization (AQU), equilibrium optimization (EO), enhanced slime mould algorithm (ESMA), Gorilla troops optimization (GTO), red kite optimization (RKO), subtraction-average-based algorithm (SAA) and slime mould algorithm (SMA). Further, their application validity is examined for optimal allocation of Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC) devices in transmission power systems. The simulations are implemented on two different IEEE power systems of 30 and 57 buses, and considering different numbers of TCSC devices. The suggested IDMO and DMO are compared to several different current and popular techniques for all applications. The findings from the simulation demonstrate that, in relation to efficiency and effectiveness, the suggested DMO beats not only the standard DMO but also a large number of other contemporary solutions. For the first system, considering three TCSC devices to be optimized and based on the mean acquired losses, the proposed IDMO accomplishes 5.65%, 0.68%, 3.72%, 16.44%, and 5.88% reduction in power losses in compared to DMO, SAA, AEO, Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) and AQU, respectively. Similarly, for the second system, the proposed IDMO achieves improvement reduction 28.96%, 54.20%, 9.44%, 60.99% and 48.54%, respectively, compared to the obtained results by the DMO, SAA, AEO, GWO and AQU.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art104;Platform-Independent Dynamic Taint Analysis for JavaScript. Previous approaches to dynamic taint analysis for JavaScript are implemented directly in a browser or JavaScript engine, limiting their applicability to a single platform and requiring ongoing maintenance as platforms evolve, or they require nontrivial program transformations. We present an approach that relies on instrumentation to encode taint propagation as instructions for an abstract machine. Our approach has two key advantages: it is platform-independent and can be used with any existing JavaScript engine, and it can track taint on primitive values without requiring the introduction of wrapper objects. Furthermore, our technique enables multiple deployment scenarios by varying when and where the generated instructions are executed and it supports indirect taint sources, i.e., situations where taint enters an application via arguments passed to dynamically registered event-listener functions. We implemented the technique for the ECMAScript 5 language in a tool called Ichnaea, and evaluated it on 22 NPM modules containing several types of injection vulnerabilities, including 4 modules containing vulnerabilities that were not previously discovered and reported. On these modules, run-time overheads range from 3.17x to 38.42x, which is significantly better than a previous transformation-based technique. We also report on a case study that shows how Ichnaea can be used to detect privacy leaks in a Tizen web application for the Samsung Gear S2 smart watch.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art105;JSCSP: A Novel Policy-Based XSS Defense Mechanism for Browsers. To mitigate cross-site scripting attacks (XSS), the W3C group recommends web service providers to employ a computer security standard called Content Security Policy (CSP). However, less than 3.7 percent of real-world websites are equipped with CSP according to Google‚Äôs survey. The low scalability of CSP is incurred by the difficulty of deployment and non-compatibility for state-of-art browsers. To explore the scalability of CSP, in this article, we propose JavaScript based CSP (JSCSP), which is able to support most of real-world browsers but also to generate security policies automatically. Specifically, JSCSP offers a novel self-defined security policy which enforces essential confinements to related items, including JavaScript functions, DOM elements and data access. Meanwhile, JSCSP has an efficient algorithm to automatically generate the policy directives and enforce them in a cascading way, which is more fine-grained and practical than the functionalities provided by CSP. We further implement JSCSP on a Chrome extension, and our evaluation shows that the extension is compatible with popular JavaScript libraries. Our JSCSP extension can detect and block the tested attacking vectors extracted from the prevalent web applications. We state that JSCSP delivers better performance compared to other XSS defense solutions.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art106;Learning How to Listen: Automatically Finding Bug Patterns in Event-Driven JavaScript APIs. Event-driven programming is widely practiced in the JavaScript community, both on the client side to handle UI events and AJAX requests, and on the server side to accommodate long-running operations such as file or network I/O. Many popular event-based APIs allow event names to be specified as free-form strings without any validation, potentially leading to lost events for which no listener has been registered and dead listeners for events that are never emitted. In previous work, Madsen et al. presented a precise static analysis for detecting such problems, but their analysis does not scale because it may require a number of contexts that is exponential in the size of the program. Concentrating on the problem of detecting dead listeners, we present an approach to learn how to use event-based APIs by first mining a large corpus of JavaScript code using a simple static analysis to identify code snippets that register an event listener, and then applying statistical modeling to identify anomalous patterns, which often indicate incorrect API usage. In a large-scale evaluation on 127,531 open-source JavaScript code bases, our technique was able to detect 75 anomalous listener-registration patterns, while maintaining a precision of 90.9% and recall of 7.5% over a validation set, demonstrating that a learning-based approach to detecting event-handling bug patterns is feasible. In an additional experiment, we investigated instances of these patterns in 25 open-source projects, and reported 30 issues to the project maintainers, of which 7 have been confirmed as bugs.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art107;Detecting Malicious JavaScript Using Structure-Based Analysis of Graph Representation. Malicious JavaScript code in web applications poses a significant threat as cyber attackers exploit it to perform various malicious activities. Detecting these malicious scripts is challenging, given their diverse nature and the continuous evolution of attack techniques. Most approaches formulate this task as a static or sequential feature of the script, which is insufficient in terms of flexibility to various attack techniques and the ability to capture the script‚Äôs semantic meaning. To address this issue, we propose an alternative approach that leverages JavaScript code‚Äôs abstract syntax tree (AST) representation, focusing on distinctive syntactic structure features. The proposed approach uses graph neural networks to extract structural features from the AST graph while considering the attribute features of individual nodes, which uses neural message passing with neighborhood aggregation. The proposed method encodes both the local AST graph structure and attributes of the nodes. It enables capturing the source code‚Äôs semantic meaning and exploits the signature structure in the AST representations. The proposed method consistently achieved high detection performance in extensive experiments on two different datasets, with accuracy scores of 99.4% and 96.92%. The obtained evaluation metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately detecting malicious JavaScript code, with our proposed method successfully detecting more than 81% for various attack types and achieving an almost twofold performance improvement on JS-Droppers compared to the sequence-based approach. In addition, we observed that the AST graph structure represented the code‚Äôs semantic meaning, exhibiting distinctive patterns and signatures that could be effectively captured using the proposed method.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art108;Circuit: A JavaScript Memory Heap-Based Approach for Precisely Detecting Cryptojacking Websites. Cryptojacking is often used by attackers as a means of gaining profits by exploiting users‚Äô resources without their consent, despite the anticipated positive effect of browser-based cryptomining. Previous approaches have attempted to detect cryptojacking websites, but they have the following limitations: (1) they failed to detect several cryptojacking websites either because of their evasion techniques or because they cannot detect JavaScript-based cryptojacking and (2) they yielded several false alarms by focusing only on limited characteristics of cryptojacking, such as counting computer resources. In this paper, we propose CIRCUIT, a precise approach for detecting cryptojacking websites. We primarily focuse on the JavaScript memory heap, which is resilient to script code obfuscation and provides information about the objects declared in the script code and their reference relations. We then extract a reference flow that can represent the script code behavior of the website from the JavaScript memory heap. Hence, CIRCUIT determines that a website is running cryptojacking if it contains a reference flow for cryptojacking. In our experiments, we found 1,813 real-world cryptojacking websites among 300K popular websites. Moreover, we provided new insights into cryptojacking by modeling the identified evasion techniques and considering the fact that characteristics of cryptojacking websites now appear on normal websites as well.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art109;Is JavaScript Call Graph Extraction Solved Yet? A Comparative Study of Static and Dynamic Tools. Code analysis is more important than ever because JavaScript is increasingly popular and actively used, both on the client and server sides. Most algorithms for analyzing vulnerabilities, finding coding issues, or inferring type depend on the call graph representation of the underlying program. Luckily, there are quite a few tools to get this job done already. However, their performance in vitro and especially in vivo has not yet been extensively compared and evaluated. In this paper, we compare several approaches for building JavaScript call graphs, namely five static and two dynamic approaches on 26 WebKit SunSpider programs, and two static and two dynamic approaches on 12 real-world Node.js programs. The tools under examination using static techniques were npm call graph, IBM WALA, Google Closure Compiler, Approximate Call Graph, and Type Analyzer for JavaScript. We performed dynamic analyzes relying on the nodejs-cg tool (a customized Node.js runtime) and the NodeProf instrumentation and profiling framework. We provide a quantitative evaluation of the results, and a result quality analysis based on 941 manually validated call edges. On the SunSpider programs, which do not take any inputs, so dynamic extraction could be complete, all the static tools also performed well. For example, TAJS found 93% of all edges while having a 97% precision compared to the precise dynamic call graph. When it comes to real-world Node.js modules, our evaluation shows that static tools struggle with parsing the code and fail to detect a significant amount of call edges that dynamic approaches can capture. Nonetheless, a significant number of edges not detected by dynamic approaches are also reported. Among these, however, there are also edges that are real, but for some reason the unit tests did not execute the branches in which these calls were included.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art110;Making JavaScript Render Decisions to Optimize Security-Oriented Crawler Process. The widespread use of web applications requires important changes in cybersecurity to protect online services and data. In the process of identifying security vulnerabilities in web applications, a systematic approach is employed to detect and mitigate cybersecurity risks. This approach utilizes web crawlers to identify attack vectors. Traditional web crawling methods are resource-intensive and often need to be more efficient in handling dynamic JavaScript-rich content. Addressing this crucial gap, our study introduces an innovative approach to predict the necessity of JavaScript rendering, thereby enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of security-oriented web crawlers. This approach seeks to reduce computational requirements and quicken the security evaluation process through the use of machine learning algorithms. By utilizing a dataset containing the source code from the main pages of 17,160 websites, our experimental results demonstrate a 20% reduction in execution time compared to full JavaScript rendering, indicating an improvement in resource usage without any significant reduction in coverage. Our methodology significantly improves the efficiency of security-focused web crawlers and helps security scanners to detect security risks of web applications with fewer resources.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art111;MELTWEB: A Transient Execution Attack to Capture Data in Fill Line Buffer. The out-of-order execution mechanism is widely used in modern processors. However, meltdown attacks exploit this mechanism to allow malicious instructions to capture sensitive data from kernel domains. This work aims to present a new meltdown attack, called Meltweb. It is a new approach in the category of privileged speculative execution attacks to leak arbitrary data into address spaces and privilege limits. Meltweb can be implemented from linear execution without the need for page faults, eliminating the need for an exception suppression mechanism, thus allowing the attack to be executed throughout the system of arbitrary code without privileges as in search engines interpretation of Javascript. To exemplify the performance of the attack, two proof-of-concept variants were developed that demonstrate the ability to perform the attack natively, as well as remotely using Javascript. The attack developed showed satisfactory results in its two variants, with 98% accuracy in capturing confidential data in the native variant. For the remote variant, the attack proved to be capable of capturing navigation data as a URL recovery with an error rate of 2.3%.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art112;An Empirical Evaluation of Using Large Language Models for Automated Unit Test Generation. Unit tests play a key role in ensuring the correctness of software. However, manually creating unit tests is a laborious task, motivating the need for automation. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been applied to various aspects of software development, including their suggested use for automated generation of unit tests, but while requiring additional training or few-shot learning on examples of existing tests. This paper presents a large-scale empirical evaluation on the effectiveness of LLMs for automated unit test generation without requiring additional training or manual effort. Concretely, we consider an approach where the LLM is provided with prompts that include the signature and implementation of a function under test, along with usage examples extracted from documentation. Furthermore, if a generated test fails, our approach attempts to generate a new test that fixes the problem by re-prompting the model with the failing test and error message. We implement our approach in TestPilot, an adaptive LLM-based test generation tool for JavaScript that automatically generates unit tests for the methods in a given project's API. We evaluate TestPilot using OpenAI's gpt3.5-turbo LLM on 25 npm packages with a total of 1,684 API functions. The generated tests achieve a median statement coverage of 70.2% and branch coverage of 52.8%. In contrast, the state-of-the feedback-directed JavaScript test generation technique, Nessie, achieves only 51.3% statement coverage and 25.6% branch coverage. Furthermore, experiments with excluding parts of the information included in the prompts show that all components contribute towards the generation of effective test suites. We also find that 92.8% of TestPilot's generated tests have $\leq$‚â§ 50% similarity with existing tests (as measured by normalized edit distance), with none of them being exact copies. Finally, we run TestPilot with two additional LLMs, OpenAI's older code-cushman-002 LLM and StarCoder, an LLM for which the training process is publicly documented. Overall, we observed similar results with the former (68.2% median statement coverage), and somewhat worse results with the latter (54.0% median statement coverage), suggesting that the effectiveness of the approach is influenced by the size and training set of the LLM, but does not fundamentally depend on the specific model.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art113;Dependency Smells in JavaScript Projects. Dependency management in modern software development poses many challenges for developers who wish to stay up to date with the latest features and fixes whilst ensuring backwards compatibility. Project maintainers have opted for varied, and sometimes conflicting, approaches for maintaining their dependencies. Opting for unsuitable approaches can introduce bugs and vulnerabilities into the project, introduce breaking changes, cause extraneous installations, and reduce dependency understandability, making it harder for others to contribute effectively. In this paper, we empirically examine evidence of recurring dependency management issues (dependency smells). We look at the commit data for a dataset of 1,146 active JavaScript repositories to catalog, quantify and understand dependency smells. Through a series of surveys with practitioners, we identify and quantify seven dependency smells with varying degrees of popularity and investigate why they are introduced throughout project history. Our findings indicate that dependency smells are prevalent in JavaScript projects with two or more distinct smells appearing in 80 percent of the projects, but they generally infect a minority of a project‚Äôs dependencies. Our observations show that the number of dependency smells tend to increase over time. Practitioners agree that dependency smells bring about many problems including security threats, bugs, dependency breakage, runtime errors, and other maintenance issues. These smells are generally introduced as developers react to dependency misbehaviour and the shortcomings of the npm ecosystem.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art114;Scalable Scalable Vector Graphics: Automatic Translation of Interactive SVGs to a Multithread VDOM for Fast Rendering. The dominant markup language for Web visualizations‚ÄîScalable Vector Graphics (SVG)‚Äîis comparatively easy to learn, and is open, accessible, customizable via CSS, and searchable via the DOM, with easy interaction handling and debugging. Because these attributes allow visualization creators to focus on design on implementation details, tools built on top of SVG, such as D3.js, are essential to the visualization community. However, slow SVG rendering can limit designs by effectively capping the number of on-screen data points, and this can force visualization creators to switch to Canvas or WebGL. These are less flexible (e.g., no search or styling via CSS), and harder to learn. We introduce Scalable Scalable Vector Graphics (SSVG) to reduce these limitations and allow complex and smooth visualizations to be created with SVG. SSVG automatically translates interactive SVG visualizations into a dynamic virtual DOM (VDOM) to bypass the browser's slow ‚Äòto specification‚Äô rendering by intercepting JavaScript function calls. De-coupling the SVG visualization specification from SVG rendering, and obtaining a dynamic VDOM, creates flexibility and opportunity for visualization system research. SSVG uses this flexibility to free up the main thread for more interactivity and renders the visualization with Canvas or WebGL on a web worker. Together, these concepts create a drop-in JavaScript library which can improve rendering performance by 3‚Äì9√ó with only one line of code added. To demonstrate applicability, we describe the use of SSVG on multiple example visualizations including published visualization research. A free copy of this article, collected data, and source code are available as open science at osf.io/ge8wp.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art115;A Systematic Literature Review and Quality Analysis of Javascript Malware Detection. Context: JavaScript (JS) is an often-used programming language by millions of web pages and is also affected by thousands of malicious attacks. Objective: In this investigation, we provided a general view and a quick understanding of JavaScript Malware Detection (JSMD) research reported in the scientific literature from several perspectives. Method: We performed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and quality analysis of published research articles on the topic. We investigated 32 articles published between the year 2009 to the year 2019. Results: Selected 32 papers explained in this article reflect the outline of what was published so far. One of our key findings is the performance of Machine Learning (ML) based detection models were relatively higher than others. We also found that only a few papers were able to achieve high scores according to the quality assessment criteria. Conclusion: In this SLR, we summarized and synthesized the existing JSMD studies to identify the previous research practices and also to shed light on future guidelines in the malware detection space. This study will guide and help future researchers to investigate the previous literature efficiently and effectively.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art116;‚ÄúI just looked for the solution!‚ÄùOn Integrating Security-Relevant Information in Non-Security API Documentation to Support Secure Coding Practices. Software developers build complex systems using plenty of third-party libraries. Documentation is key to understand and use the functionality provided via the libraries‚Äô APIs. Therefore, functionality is the main focus of contemporary API documentation, while cross-cutting concerns such as security are almost never considered at all, especially when the API itself does not provide security features. Documentations of JavaScript libraries for use in web applications, e.g., do not specify how to add or adapt a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate content injection attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This is unfortunate, as security-relevant API documentation might have an influence on secure coding practices and prevailing major vulnerabilities such as XSS. For the first time, we study the effects of integrating security-relevant information in non-security API documentation. For this purpose, we took CSP as an exemplary study object and extended the official Google Maps JavaScript API documentation with security-relevant CSP information in three distinct manners. Then, we evaluated the usage of these variations in a between-group eye-tracking lab study involving N=49 participants. Our observations suggest: (1) Developers are focused on elements with code examples. They mostly skim the documentation while searching for a quick solution to their programming task. This finding gives further evidence to results of related studies. (2) The location where CSP-related code examples are placed in non-security API documentation significantly impacts the time it takes to find this security-relevant information. In particular, the study results showed that the proximity to functional-related code examples in documentation is a decisive factor. (3) Examples significantly help to produce secure CSP solutions. (4) Developers have additional information needs that our approach cannot meet. Overall, our study contributes to a first understanding of the impact of security-relevant information in non-security API documentation on CSP implementation. Although further research is required, our findings emphasize that API producers should take responsibility for adequately documenting security aspects and thus supporting the sensibility and training of developers to implement secure systems. This responsibility also holds in seemingly non-security relevant contexts.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art117;o-glasses: Visualizing X86 Code From Binary Using a 1D-CNN. Malicious document files used in targeted attacks often contain a small program called shellcode. It is often hard to prepare a runnable environment for dynamic analysis of these document files because they exploit specific vulnerabilities. In these cases, it is necessary to identify the position of the shellcode in each document file to analyze it. If the exploit code uses executable scripts such as JavaScript and Flash, it is not so hard to locate the shellcode. On the other hand, it is sometimes almost impossible to locate the shellcode when it does not contain any JavaScript or Flash but consists of native x86 code only. Binary fragment classification is often applied to visualize the location of regions of interest, and shellcode must contain at least a small fragment of x86 native code even if most of it is obfuscated, such as a decoder for the obfuscated body of the shellcode. In this paper, we propose a novel method, o-glasses, to visualize the shellcode by recognizing the x86 native code using a specially designed one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1d-CNN). The fragment size needs to be as small as the minimum size of the x86 native code in the whole shellcode. Our results show that a 16-instruction-sequence (approximately 48 bytes on average) is sufficient for the code fragment visualization. Our method, o-glasses (1d-CNN), outperforms other methods in that it recognizes x86 native code with a surprisingly high F-measure rate (about 99.95%).;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art118;DiffSearch: A Scalable and Precise Search Engine for Code Changes. The source code of successful projects is evolving all the time, resulting in hundreds of thousands of code changes stored in source code repositories. This wealth of data can be useful, e.g., to find changes similar to a planned code change or examples of recurring code improvements. This paper presents DiffSearch, a search engine that, given a query that describes a code change, returns a set of changes that match the query. The approach is enabled by three key contributions. First, we present a query language that extends the underlying programming language with wildcards and placeholders, providing an intuitive way of formulating queries that is easy to adapt to different programming languages. Second, to ensure scalability, the approach indexes code changes in a one-time preprocessing step, mapping them into a feature space, and then performs an efficient search in the feature space for each query. Third, to guarantee precision, i.e., that any returned code change indeed matches the given query, we present a tree-based matching algorithm that checks whether a query can be expanded to a concrete code change. We present implementations for Java, JavaScript, and Python, and show that the approach responds within seconds to queries across one million code changes, has a recall of 80.7% for Java, 89.6% for Python, and 90.4% for JavaScript, enables users to find relevant code changes more effectively than a regular expression-based search and GitHub's search feature, and is helpful for gathering a large-scale dataset of real-world bug fixes.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art119;Forecasting the Principal of Code Technical Debt in JavaScript Applications. JavaScript (JS) is one of the most popular programming languages for developing client-side applications mainly due to allowing the adoption of different programming styles, not having strict syntax rules, and supporting a plethora of frameworks. The flexibility that the language provides may accelerate the development of application, but also pose threats to the quality of the final software product, e.g., introducing Technical Debt (TD). TD reflects the additional cost of software maintenance activities to implement new features, occurring due to poorly developed solutions. Being able to forecast the levels of TD in the future can be extremely valuable in managing TD, since it can contribute to informed decision making when designating future repayments and refactoring budget among a company's projects. Despite the popularity of JS and the undoubtful benefits of accurate TD forecasting, in the literature, there is available only a limited number of tools and methodologies that are able to: (a) forecast TD during software evolution, (b) provide a ground-truth TD quantifications to train forecasting, since TD tools that are available are based on different rulesets and none is recognized as a state-of-the-art solution, (c) take into consideration the language-specific characteristics of JS. As a main contribution for this study, we propose a methodology (along with a supporting tool) that supports the aforementioned goals based on the Backward Stepwise Regression and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). We evaluate the proposed approach through a case study on 19,636 releases of 105 open-source applications. The results point out that: (a) the proposed model can lead to an accurate prediction of TD, and (b) the Number of appearances of the ‚Äúnew‚Äù and ‚Äúeval‚Äù keyword along with the number of ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù and ‚Äúarrow‚Äù functions are among the features of JavaScript language that are related to high levels of TD.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art120;Analyzing In-Browser Cryptojacking. Cryptojacking is the permissionless use of a target device to covertly mine cryptocurrencies. With cryptojacking, attackers use malicious JavaScript codes to force web browsers into solving proof-of-work puzzles, thus making money by exploiting the resources of the website visitors. We systematically analyze the static, dynamic, and economic aspects of in-browser cryptojacking to understand and counter such attacks. For static analysis, we perform currency-based and code-based categorization of cryptojacking samples to 1) measure their distribution across websites, 2) highlight their platform affinities, and 3) study their code complexities. We apply machine learning techniques to distinguish cryptojacking scripts from benign and malicious JavaScript samples with 100% accuracy. For dynamic analysis, we analyze the effect of cryptojacking on critical system resources, such as CPU and battery usage. We also perform web browser fingerprinting to analyze the information exchange between the victim node and the dropzone cryptojacking server. We also build an analytical model to empirically evaluate the feasibility of cryptojacking as an alternative to online advertisement. Our results show a sizeable negative profit and loss gap, indicating that the model is economically infeasible. Finally, leveraging insights from our analyses, we build countermeasures for in-browser cryptojacking that improve the existing remedies.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art121;Hybrid Laboratory of Radio Communication With Online Simulators and Remote Access. Contribution: Two toolsets for the remote teaching of radio communication laboratory classes: 1) online simulators for individual work of students and 2) a remote access system to laboratory workstations for group work. Initial assumptions and method of implementation of both tools are presented. Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced a change in teaching at all levels of education. The specificity of practical classes, such as laboratories, means that the tools used must often be atypical, prepared for a specific type of activity. Intended Outcomes: Hybrid laboratory with tools for remote learning in the form of online simulators and remote access to laboratory workstations, enabling students to achieve the same educational results in the field of radiocommunication as presential classes. Application Design: Online simulators were prepared as Javascript code run in a Web browser as part of a html page, which provide easy integration with various learning platforms and Web servers. The remote access system uses Javascript code for the user interface and a gateway server based on an Apache Web server and FastCGI interface to communicate with C/C++ programs responsible for controlling measuring equipment. Findings: Online simulators have been positively assessed by students during two years of remote learning, but comparison of the grades from remote and presential classes is inconclusive. The obtained grades were comparable in the first year of remote laboratories, but they were worse in the second year than the grades from classroom learning. The system for remote access to the laboratory stands has not yet been evaluated.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art122;metaSafer: A Technique to Detect Heap Metadata Corruption in WebAssembly. WebAssembly (Wasm), a technology enabling efficient native code execution in web browsers, has seen a significant rise in adoption as a popular compilation target. This has led to the emergence of lightweight web services powered by Wasm, characterized by their small binary size and reduced data transfer overhead, thanks to the inherent efficiency of Wasm. Despite their lightweight nature, these services can deliver powerful features like image/video processing, AI and graphical application that surpass the capabilities of JavaScript. To ensure lightweight web services and enhance the overall web experience, Wasm has been extensively optimized. However, these optimizations have raised concerns about memory safety, leading to memory-related vulnerabilities. Wasm‚Äôs characteristic memory structure, linear memory, has vulnerabilities that provide various attack vectors to attackers. In particular, it presents various attack possibilities through metadata modification containing memory structure information. Attackers can exploit heap memory overflow in Wasm applications, allowing them to target arbitrary memory addresses, modify data, or execute arbitrary code. Such overflows can corrupt memory metadata, resulting in incorrect memory behavior. While research has mitigate memory-related weaknesses in languages such as C and C++ and architectures like X86 in recent decades, the direct application of security solutions designed for different domains to Wasm is not a practical approach. Consequently, allocators in Wasm remain vulnerable to issues like heap overflow and metadata corruption. Thus, there is a pressing need for tailored memory safety techniques and solutions that accommodate Wasm‚Äôs architecture-agnostic and linear memory structures. In this paper, we propose metaSafer as a solution. By shadowing metadata from Wasm linear memory to JavaScript virtual machine memory and conducting metadata verification, metaSafer effectively blocks attack attempts and vectors. Notably, our solution achieves fast memory shadowing and validation while maintaining a small code size. Through various verification processes, we measured the performance and code size of metaSafer, revealing that it is a software-only security solution with no additional hardware requirements. metaSafer demonstrates robust metadata protection for Wasm applications with an acceptable performance overhead of up to 8% in SQLite speed tests and Polybench benchmarks.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art123;Self-Driving Car Navigation With Single-Beam LiDAR and Neural Networks Using JavaScript. This paper presents the development of a system for simulating and visualizing autonomous vehicle navigation using a single-beam LiDAR sensor integrated with an artificial neural network, implemented entirely in JavaScript. The single-beam LiDAR sensor in the simulation was configured to closely resemble real-world counterparts, such as the YDLIDAR TG30. The proposed neural network architecture, consisting of four output neurons, processes data from ten distinct angular measurements of the LiDAR sensor to predict necessary steering and speed adjustments for autonomous navigation. Furthermore, we introduce an enhanced collision detection algorithm that improves upon traditional methods by providing more precise identification of line segment intersections. Implementing the entire system in JavaScript demonstrates the viability of utilizing web technologies for complex machine learning tasks, representing a significant advancement in autonomous vehicle research. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this approach across various scenarios, emphasizing its potential for broader applications in cost-sensitive autonomous systems. This work may also serve as a valuable resource for researchers new to machine learning, contributing to greater accessibility in the development of autonomous vehicles.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art124;X-Check: Improving Effectiveness and Efficiency of Cross-Browser Issues Detection for JavaScript-Based Web Applications. Web 2.0 application based on JavaScript is a wide-spread application domain today as it delivers rich, interactive user experiences. However, with the increasing number of browsers and platforms on which the applications can be executed, cross-browser incompatibilities (XBIs) are becoming a serious problem for organizations to develop modern JavaScript-based Web applications. Although lots of XBIs detection techniques have been proposed, there are still some limitations: 1) existing techniques are prone to generating certain false positives/negatives that result from the fact that they ignore non-deterministic events (e.g., timer, asynchronous request/response) inside the browser;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art125;Automatic Code Generation for Language-Learning Applications. Language-learning applications define exercises that are pedagogical tools to introduce new language concepts. The development of this type of applications is complex due to the diversity of language-learning methodologies, the variety of execution environments and the number of different technologies that can be used. This article proposes a complete Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) approach, from the definition of the Computational Independent Model (CIM layer) to the Implementation Specific Model (ISM layer), and the process of the necessary transformations for the automatic generation of the source code (in HTML and JavaScript) of language-learning applications. To carry out the model-to-model and model-to-text transformations, the ATLAS Transformation Language (ATL) and Acceleo transformation languages have been used respectively. The proposal has been validated through the modeling and the complete automatic generation of source code of two Learning Activity Mechanisms (LAM), which are used within methodologies such as Duolingo and Busuu: LAM Image-Audio-Text and LAM Audio-Text Options.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art126;Improving the Instruction Fetch Throughput with Dynamically Configuring the Fetch Pipeline. Instruction cache misses are the critical performance bottleneck in the execution of recent workloads such as Web applications written in JavaScript and server applications. Although various instruction prefetchers have been proposed to reduce the misses, the requirements for both high miss coverage and small hardware cost are not satisfied. In this article, we propose a novel method that improves the instruction fetch throughput not by instruction prefetching but by dynamically configuring the fetch pipeline structure. Our scheme switches between the normal pipeline and newly introduced miss-assuming pipeline, which does not degrade the fetch throughput even when L1 instruction cache misses occur. Our method achieves high instruction fetch throughput with simple hardware and small cost unlike previously proposed prefetchers. Our evaluation results using Web and database workloads show that our method improves the performance by 16.6 percent and 8.6 percent on average, compared to that with noprefetching and the state-of-the-art instruction prefetcher, PIF, respectively, and achieves as much as 79.0 percent of the performance of the processor with a perfect instruction cache.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art127;Descriptor: Soccer Player Transfer Dataset (SPTD). Soccer is the most played and studied sport globally. Its enormous popularity attracts billions of spectators for major events such as the F√©d√©ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup and continental championships, generating a significant financial flow from ticket sales, TV contracts, marketing, and merchandising. Soccer player transfers between soccer clubs are a major financial aspect of soccer. This process allows clubs to sell and buy players, allowing them to acquire a significant amount of money quickly. These transactions are documented and classified on the Transfermarkt website, which contains a substantial volume of transfer data, encompassing buy and sell transactions and loan transfers between teams. This work builds a comprehensive database of male soccer player transfers. We collected the data from the Transfermarkt website using information retrieval algorithms. The collected data were organized, structured, and made available in four formats: 1) a relational database easily accessible through structured query language (SQL);art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art128;Comparing XML and JSON Characteristics as Formats for Data Serialization Within Ultralow Power Embedded Systems. Javascript object notation (JSON) and extensible markup language (XML) are two data serialization methods that have been compared over many applications, including client-server transmission, Internet communication, and large-scale data storage. Due to the smaller file size, JSON is faster for transmitting data. However, XML is better for sending complex data structures. This letter compares the two data formats in the context of an embedded system, considering factors, such as time, memory, and power to identify efficient characteristics of each method. Programs for each format were written, optimized, and compared for the same dataset. The JSON file was found to be 24.7% smaller than the XML file. This led to a shorter program run-time and less power being consumed when reading and processing the file. However, the program to deserialize the XML file took up 16.7% less flash memory than its JSON counterpart. Overall, JSON was found to be a better choice for systems when collecting large amounts of data, requiring high speed communication, or running for an extended period between battery charges. However, XML is proposed for systems that have limited flash memory.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art129;Autism Detection of MRI Brain Images Using Hybrid Deep CNN With DM-Resnet Classifier. The neurodevelopmental Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) causes problems in social communication. Earlier diagnosis of ASD from brain image is necessary for reducing the effect of disorder. In this paper, deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Dwarf Mongoose optimized Residual Network (DM-ResNet) is proposed for the classification of autism disorder from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain images. Initially, the input brain images are preprocessed to remove the non-brain tissues. The preprocessed images are segmented with hybrid Fuzzy C Means (FCM) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) which partition the image into sub groups to make it easier for classification by reducing the complexity. FCM-GMM segments the volume into predefined cortical and sub cortical regions. After segmentation, the features are extracted with Visual Geometry Group (VGG)-16 networks which comprised of several tiny kernels with filters for enhancing the depth of network and permit to extract complicated and discriminative features. Region of Interest (ROI) based functional connectivity feature is extracted with VGG-16 and these features are classified with DM optimized ResNet. The hyper parameters are optimized with DM optimization algorithm which improves the accuracy of classifier. By using the proposed approach, the accuracy of autism detection is improved to 99.83%.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art130;Optimal Power Flow Analysis With Renewable Energy Resource Uncertainty Using Dwarf Mongoose Optimizer: Case of ADRAR Isolated Electrical Network. Over the last twin decades, significant advancements have occurred in global electricity grids due to the widespread adoption of renewable energy resources (RES). While these sources play an essential role in total generation cost reduction, transmission power loss minimization, and reduction of environmental hazards related to traditional power plants. Still, however, the optimal planning and operation of the power system in the presence RES is considered a primary challenge due to the their stochastic natural and intermittency. One of the most complex and motivating issues in a power system is optimal power flow (OPF), a constrained optimization problem characterized by non-linearity and non-convexity. From these specifications, researchers competed in the past decades to find optimal solutions to stochastic OPF problems while keeping system stability. To tackle this challenge, an effective optimization algorithm which mimics on the foraging behavior of dwarf mongooses‚Äô in the nature is introduced. The objective function considers reserve cost for overestimation and penalty cost for underestimation of intermittent renewable sources. To show the robustness and efficacy of the recommended optimizer, case studies on the customized IEEE 30-bus system and a realistic power system DZA 26-bus (isolated grid) are undertaken. Numerical findings show that the proposed DMOA beats all previous published-results and performs better over a variety of objective functions while finding high-quality optimally viable solutions. The obtained results demonstrate that the DMOA realized exceptional performance for both the test networks, with total generation cost minimized values of 780.982  ${\$}$ /h and 8283.942 US ${\$}$ /h, respectively. These results highlight the precision and robustness of DMOA in effectively addressing various instances of the OPF problem Furthermore, the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, a statistical approach, was employed to evaluate the superiority of the proposed algorithm and to highlight a certain level of confidence to our study.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art131;Quantum Dwarf Mongoose Optimization With Ensemble Deep Learning Based Intrusion Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems. Cyber-physical systems (CPS) combine computational and physical elements to enable effective and intelligent control of several applications. However, the increasing connectivity and complexity of CPS introduce new security challenges, making intrusion detection a critical aspect for maintaining the integrity and reliability of these systems. The rise in artificial intelligence (AI) techniques assists in addressing security problems related to CPS environments. Therefore, this study proposes a Quantum Dwarf Mongoose Optimization with Ensemble Deep Learning Based Intrusion Detection (QDMO-EDLID) technique in the CPS environment. The presented QDMO-EDLID technique aims to recognize the presence of intrusions by the feature selection (FS) and ensemble learning process. For feature subset selection purposes, the QDMO-EDLID technique employs the QDMO algorithm. Moreover, an ensemble of Convolution Residual Networks (CRN), Deep Belief Networks (DBN), and Deep Autoencoder (DAE) models are applied for the intrusion classification process. The experimental outcome of the QDMO-EDLID technique was tested employing benchmark intrusion databases. The simulation results highlighted the improved efficiency of the QDMO-EDLID approach concerning different performance measures.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art132;Multi-Task Learning for Electricity Price Forecasting and Resource Management in Cloud Based Industrial IoT Systems. Cloud computing has gained immense popularity in the logistics industry. This innovative technology optimizes computing operations by eliminating the requirement for physical equipment for calculations. Instead, specialized companies provide cloud-based computing services, relying heavily on computers and servers that consume substantial amounts of energy. Hence, ensuring the availability of affordable and dependable electricity is paramount for the efficient design and management of these logistics services. Cloud centers, which are power-intensive, face the challenge of reducing their energy consumption due to escalating power costs. To address this issue, efficient data placement and node management strategies are commonly employed in logistics operations. An AlexNet model has been designed to optimize storage relocation and predict power prices. The outcome of this initiative has resulted in a considerable reduction in energy consumption at data centres. The model uses Dwarf Mongoose Optimization Algorithm (DMOA) to produce an optimal solution for the AlexNet and increase its performance with a real-world dataset from IESO in Ontario, Canada. 75% of the available data was used for training to assure the model‚Äôs precision, with the remaining 25% allocated to testing purposes. The model forecasts power prices with an MAE of 2.22% and an MSE of 6.33%, resulting in an average reduction of 22.21% in electricity expenses.

art133;Enhancing Security in IoT-Assisted UAV Networks Using Adaptive Mongoose Optimization Algorithm With Deep Learning. Due to the sensitive and mission-critical nature of the data collected and transferred, security in IoT-assisted UAV networks is of great significance. Intrusion detection in IoT-assisted UAV networks includes the deployment of complex monitoring systems to identify and respond to cyberattacks, physical breaches, or unauthorized access. This system employs a combination of anomaly detection and signature-based methods to find malicious or unusual activities within the network. A robust intrusion detection mechanism is essential for protecting the security and integrity of the UAVs and the data collected, ensuring that any possible vulnerabilities are promptly addressed and identified. Consequently, this study introduces an adaptive mongoose optimizer algorithm with a deep learning-based intrusion detection (AMOA-DLID) method in IoT-assisted UAV networks. The AMOA-DLID technique intends to ensure security in the IoT-assisted UAV networks via an intrusion detection process. In the presented AMOA-DLID technique, AMOA is initially applied for the feature selection process. The following sparse autoencoder (SAE) model can be exploited for the recognition of the intrusions. Lastly, the recognition rate of the SAE model can be improved by employing the Harris Hawks optimizer (HHO) technique. The detailed experimental study of the AMOA-DLID model is performed on the benchmark dataset of IDS. The extensive results portrayed that the AMOA-DLID technique reaches improved security over other models on the IoT-assisted UAV networks.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art134;Neuro-adaptive finite time composite fault tolerant control for attitude control systems of satellites. An adaptive finite time composite fault tolerant control strategy based on an optimized neural network for Attitude control systems (ACSs) of satellites is proposed considering the state time-varying delays, concurrent actuator and sensor faults, system uncertainties, modelable external disturbance and operating noise. An uncertain time-varying state space model for ACSs of satellites is established, and sensor faults are equivalent to actuator-like faults. A disturbance observer is designed for estimating the modelable external disturbance, and an improved dwarf mongoose optimization (DMO) algorithm based on the Levy flight distribution is utilized to optimize the basis function of hyperbasis function neural networks to better estimate the augmented actuator faults that include the actuator fault and the actuator-like fault. Furthermore, an adaptive finite time composite fault-tolerant controller is proposed, which includes the delay-dependent feedback control law, disturbance estimation based-disturbance compensation law and the adaptive fault compensation law based on the augmented fault estimation using the improved DMO-hyper basis function neural network. The finite time boundness of the close-loop dynamics to the uncertainties, operating noise, and augmented actuator faults and the robustness of the measurement to the uncertainties, operating noise and augmented actuator faults are analyzed, and the observer and controller design is formulated as the linear matrix inequalities. Simulation examples for ACSs in different working conditions are considered to exhibit the proposed method's effectiveness.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

art136;Employing Blockchain Technology to Strengthen Security of Wireless Sensor Networks. The proposed approach uses blockchain-based technology to strengthen the data security of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). This paper integrates blockchain-based technology with data transfer to establish an extremely secure WSNs structure. The present wireless network is built on the architecture of the Internet of Things (IoT) and employs a blockchain-based method to make the reliability of data transmission strong. In this proposed research, many small-area wireless sensor networks establish the entire WSNs structure, and every small-area wireless sensor network has a primary data collection node called a ‚Äúmobile database.‚Äù The ‚Äúmobile database‚Äù node of this study uses embedded microcontrollers with an operating system, such as Raspberry Pi and Arduino Yun. This block contains the sensor data collected by itself and the hash value of the previous block. Then the hash value of its own block, which is also part of the hash calculation of the next block, was calculated through the mining calculation program. Any block in the proposed method includes the encrypted hash-value of the previous block, the current timestamp, and the transaction data. In our research content, the transaction data is represented as wireless network sensing data. Basically, the system employs the hash function for calculation using the Merkel-tree algorithm. Such programming makes the block with blockchain-based technology difficult to tamper with content. This study approach revises the blockchain-based transaction ledger to become a sensor data record. Therefore, the proposed system gathers and analyzes sensor data for more reliability in the wireless sensing network structure. Furthermore, the innovative system with blockchain-based technology can treat a private cloud-end. This paper also carries on to visualize the uploaded sensing data by the sensors and draws corresponding charts based on big data analysis. The wireless network architecture proposed in this paper is built on embedded devices, making it easy for the system to build a web server. Using Python or JavaScript programming language in the web environment is relatively more convenient for data visualization and data analysis. Finally, this study uses traditional methods and innovative methods to compare data transmission. When the system uses innovative methods with blockchain-based technology, it is almost impossible for any operator to tamper with the data transmitted by the sensor.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art137;RefDiff 2.0: A Multi-Language Refactoring Detection Tool. Identifying refactoring operations in source code changes is valuable to understand software evolution. Therefore, several tools have been proposed to automatically detect refactorings applied in a system by comparing source code between revisions. The availability of such infrastructure has enabled researchers to study refactoring practice in large scale, leading to important advances on refactoring knowledge. However, although a plethora of programming languages are used in practice, the vast majority of existing studies are restricted to the Java language due to limitations of the underlying tools. This fact poses an important threat to external validity. Thus, to overcome such limitation, in this paper we propose RefDiff 2.0, a multi-language refactoring detection tool. Our approach leverages techniques proposed in our previous work and introduces a novel refactoring detection algorithm that relies on the Code Structure Tree (CST), a simple yet powerful representation of the source code that abstracts away the specificities of particular programming languages. Despite its language-agnostic design, our evaluation shows that RefDiff's precision (96 percent) and recall (80 percent) are on par with state-of-the-art refactoring detection approaches specialized in the Java language. Our modular architecture also enables one to seamlessly extend RefDiff to support other languages via a plugin system. As a proof of this, we implemented plugins to support two other popular programming languages: JavaScript and C. Our evaluation in these languages reveals that precision and recall ranges from 88 to 91 percent. With these results, we envision RefDiff as a viable alternative for breaking the single-language barrier in refactoring research and in practical applications of refactoring detection.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as machine translation, question answering, summarization, and so on. Additionally, LLMs are also highly valuable in supporting software engineering tasks, particularly in the field of code generation. Automatic code generation is a process of automatically generating source code or executable code based on given specifications or requirements, improving developer productivity. In this study, we perform a systematic empirical assessment to the quality of code generation using ChatGPT, a recent state-of-the-art product LLM. We leverage 728 algorithm problems in five languages (i.e., C, C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript) and 18 CWEs with 54 code scenarios for the code generation task. Our evaluation encompasses a comprehensive analysis of code snippets generated by ChatGPT, focusing on three critical aspects: correctness, complexity, and security. We also specifically investigate ChatGPT's ability to engage in multi-round fixing process (i.e., ChatGPT's dialog ability, chatting between users and ChatGPT for fixing generated buggy code) of facilitating code generation. By delving into the generated code and examining the experimental results, this work provides valuable insights into the performance of ChatGPT in tackling code generation tasks over the three critical aspects. The experimental results demonstrate that (1) ChatGPT is better at generating functionally correct code for problems before 2021 in different languages than problems after 2021 with $48.14\%$48.14% advantage in Accepted rate on judgment platform, but ChatGPT's ability to directly fix erroneous code with multi-round fixing process to achieve correct functionality is relatively weak;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The combination of diverse data types and analysis tasks in genomics has resulted in the development of a wide range of visualization techniques and tools.

In this paper, we present a component model design for data visualization to promote modular designs of visualization tools that enhance their analytical scope. Rather than fragmenting tasks across tools, the component model supports unification, where components‚Äîthe building blocks of this model‚Äîcan be assembled to support a wide range of tasks. Furthermore, the model also provides additional key properties, such as support for collaboration, sharing across multiple devices, and adaptive usage depending on expertise, from creating visualizations using dropdown menus, through instantiating components, to actually modifying components or creating entirely new ones from scratch using JavaScript or Python source code. To realize our model, we introduce Vistrates, a literate computing platform for developing, assembling, and sharing visualization components. From a visualization perspective, Vistrates features cross-cutting components for visual representations, interaction, collaboration, and device responsiveness maintained in a component repository. From a development perspective, Vistrates offers a collaborative programming environment where novices and experts alike can compose component pipelines for specific analytical activities. Finally, we present several Vistrates use cases that span the full range of the classic ‚Äúanytime‚Äù and ‚Äúanywhere‚Äù motto for ubiquitous analysis: from mobile and on-the-go usage, through office settings, to collaborative smart environments covering a variety of tasks and devices.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art143;Digital Twin-Driven Fault Diagnosis for Autonomous Surface Vehicles. This paper presents a digital twin-driven fault diagnosis approach based on a graphical model and an adaptive extended Kalman filter algorithm for autonomous surface vehicles. In contrast with the traditional adaptive Kalman filter algorithm, where the fault parameters are treated as extended state variables, the newly proposed adaptive extended Kalman filter algorithm estimates the magnitude of the faults by calculating the parameter estimation gains directly from the sensor systems. To this end, the algorithm utilizes data from a global navigation satellite system receiver assuming the persistence of excitation conditions on the control inputs. The algorithm is tested in the Otter, an autonomous surface vehicle developed by Maritime Robotics, in which one of its propellers is faulty. Technically, the digital twin receives real-time data from the sensor system, estimates the magnitude of the actuator faults, and visualizes the results in a web-based application using JavaScript with Three.js library and Mapbox for real-world 3D map generation. Information regarding the magnitude of the faults is important for fault-tolerant control. Simulation and experimental results show the proposed approach is able to detect and estimate the actuator faults accurately.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art144;Tooee: A Novel Scratch Extension for K-12 Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Education Using Text-Based Visual Blocks. Many approaches have been proposed to teach the basic concepts of big data and artificial intelligence to K-12 students based on block-based programming languages, such as Scratch. Using these approaches, young students can easily experience big data and artificial intelligence through a drag-and-drop approach. However, it remains difficult for them to perform more complex tasks, such as directly collecting data from the web or exploiting custom-made machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel Scratch extension that allows Scratch to communicate with text-based programming languages such as Python and JavaScript using WebSockets. Unlike other Scratch extensions, our extension greatly enhances the extensibility of Scratch given its use of ‚Äútext-based visual blocks‚Äù so that messages can be freely exchanged through a minimum number of blocks. In order for students to use these blocks easily, the blocks are designed such that they can be used as if talking with a friend named ‚ÄúTooee.‚Äù In order to show how this extension can help students create big data and artificial intelligence programs, we present eight example applications that students can easily implement. These are (1) Weather Forecast, (2) Top 5 Movies in Theaters, (3) COVID-19 Dashboard, (4) Saving Quiz Results to a CSV File, (5) Facial Image Classification, (6) Color Classification, (7) Object Classification, and (8) Handwriting Recognition. Our analyses and experimental results show that Tooee has several advantages over other educational environments.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art145;Website Fingerprinting Through the Cache Occupancy Channel and its Real World Practicality. Website fingerprinting attacks use statistical analysis on network traffic to compromise user privacy. The classical attack model used to evaluate website fingerprinting attacks assumes an on-path adversary, who observes traffic traveling between the user's computer and the network. In this article we investigate a different attack model, in which the adversary sends JavaScript code to the target user's computer. This code mounts a cache side-channel attack to identify other websites being browsed. Using machine learning techniques to classify traces of cache activity, we achieve high classification accuracy in both the open-world and the closed-world models. Our attack is more resistant than network-based fingerprinting to the effects of response caching, and resilient both to network-based defenses and to side-channel countermeasures. We carry out a real-world evaluation of several aspects of our attack, exploring the impact of the changes in websites and browsers over time, as well as of the attacker's ability to guess the software and hardware configuration of the target user's computer. To protect against cache-based website fingerprinting, new defense mechanisms must be introduced to privacy-sensitive browsers and websites. We investigate one such mechanism, and show that it reduces the effectiveness of the attack and completely eliminates it when used in the Tor Browser.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art146;Solidity Code Generation From UML State Machines in Model-Driven Smart Contract Development. For the development of blockchain smart contracts, a structured approach based on the principles of the Model Driven Architecture can be beneficial and facilitate the implementation of smart contracts. This paper presents such an approach, which, in combination with Unified Modeling Language (UML) Class and State machine diagrams, allows the smart contract structure and behavior logic to be modeled in several abstraction layers. This paper delves into details on how the model-to-model transformations from the specified Blockchain Platform Independent Model (PIM) with specified state-like behavior can be used to produce a Solidity Platform Specific Model (PSM). Subsequently, we elaborate on how the Solidity PSM is used for Solidity smart contract code generation by employing model-to-text transformations. The paper also demonstrates the process of our proposed transformations and code generation using smart contract code examples from Solidity documentation. Based on the examples, a Blockchain PIM is specified and transformed to Solidity PSM, which is then used for Solidity smart contract code generation. The generated smart contract code is then compiled, deployed on the Ethereum blockchain JavaScript virtual machine, and compared to the original smart contract code in terms of Solidity code metrics, similarity scores, and execution costs. The evaluation results indicate that our approach could be successfully used to model and later generate smart contract code.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art147;IoT-Enabled Vacant Parking Slot Detection System Using Inkjet-Printed RFID Tags. It is challenging for motorists to manually search for a parking slot in a crowded parking area. Conventional methods for locating vacant or occupied space are regarded as inefficient and unreliable. In this work, an Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled vacant parking slot detection system is developed and tested using low-cost inkjet-printed passive ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. The working principle of the proposed system is to analyze the backscattered signal strength from the tags at the receiver side for vehicle presence/ absence detection in the parking slots. First of all, we propose a low-cost passive tag optimized to work in UHF RFID-band pasted on plastic material display for parking slots. The data collected by the RFID reader from the tags is sent over message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol via Scotland 5G-network to the MongoDB database using a Python module Pymongo for decision-making and display of vacant parking slots to the motorists. A Python-based web-app extracts data from the database and shows it on a web-app display using the embedded JavaScript template (EJS) for each slot. Experimental observations conducted at parking slots in the presence of vehicles indicate a drastic reduction in the received-signal-strength-index (RSSI) value at the receiver end, which implies that RSSI signal drop can be utilized for the detection of vehicle presence in the parking slot. The suggested approach aims to facilitate the economical and effective location of available parking slots. The test results for the proposed system are recorded and presented, demonstrating its significant performance and showing great accuracy for the tested scenarios.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art148;Rendering Optimization for Mobile Web 3D Based on Animation Data Separation and On-Demand Loading. Based on advances in image processing technology and Web-enabling technologies for mobile devices, mobile Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) has developed rapidly. The rendering and interaction of 3D models is an important part of AR and VR applications and is closely related to user experience. However, since the existing WebGL 3D JavaScript libraries for Web-based mobile 3D (represented by three.js and babylon.js) load the entire model file at once, large-size 3D models with complex interactions cannot be rendered smoothly due to limited data transmission, the weak computation capabilities of mobile Web browsers, and the latency of 3D model rendering. In this paper, we first propose model-animation data separation and an on-demand loading mechanism to improve the data request and loading process of Web 3D models. The main mechanisms are the following: (1) The model data are segmented into topological data and animation data sequences, and only the necessary data of the model are loaded when the Web-based mobile 3D model is first rendered. (2) The 3D model animation data sequence is semantically decomposed, and a multigranular model animation data service is established to provide continuous animation data support. (3) An asynchronous request-response mechanism is used to optimize the loading method of the model data. The model rendering mechanism uses an on-demand request and rendering method to transform the centralized loading process of the 3D model into a decentralized process. According to the testing and verification results, this optimization method can reduce the latency of mobile Web 3D in model data transmission and rendering by 24.72% for the experiment models. The interaction experience of Web-based mobile AR and VR is substantially improved relative to existing Web 3D rendering engines and rendering mechanisms, especially in complex interactive service scenarios.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art149;Policychain: A Decentralized Authorization Service With Script-Driven Policy on Blockchain for Internet of Things. The decentralization mechanism provides manufacturers and distributors with greater customization and flexibility they need through Internet of Things (IoT)-based industrial collaboration systems (IoT-ICS), but it has brought forward security concerns about the shared data-processing tasks and IoT-based access to services and resources. To address them, we propose a practical blockchain solution to achieve decentralized policy management and evaluation on attribute-based access control (ABAC). By offloading the responsibility of ABAC policy administration and decision making to blockchain nodes, a blockchain-based access control framework, called Policychain, is presented to ensure policy with high availability, autonomy, and traceability. To deliver a solid design, we first present a transaction-oriented policy expression scheme with a well-defined syntax and semantics. The scheme can translate ABAC policies into the blockchain transactions with JavaScript object notation (JSON) syntax and script-based logical expression. We further realize a script-driven policy evaluation by extending blockchain inherent scripting instructions to support attribute acquisition of ABAC entities. Furthermore, we propose a policy lifecycle management scheme from policy creation, renovation, to revocation, in which policies are verified by three validation principles at the transaction level. Finally, we provide sophisticated analysis and experiments to show that our framework is secure and practical for decentralized policy management on ABAC in IoT-ICS.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art150;A Longitudinal View of Dual-Stacked Websites‚ÄîFailures, Latency and Happy Eyeballs. IPv6 measurement studies have focussed on measuring IPv6 adoption, while studies on measuring IPv6 performance have either become dated or only provide a snapshot view. We provide a longitudinal view of the performance of dual-stacked websites. We show that (since 2013) latency towards ALEXA 10K websites with AAAA entries over the six years have reduced by 29% over IPv4 and by 57% over IPv6. As of Dec 2018, 56% of these websites are faster over IPv6 with 95% of the rest being at most 1 ms slower. We also identify glitches in web content delivery that once fixed can help improve the user experience over IPv6. Using a publicly available dataset, we show that 40% of ALEXA 1M websites with AAAA entries were not accessible over IPv6 in 2009. These complete failures have reduced to 1.9% as of Jan 2019. However, our data collection on partial failures helps identify further that 27% of these popular websites with AAAA entries still suffer from partial failure over IPv6. These partial failures are affected by DNS resolution errors on images, javascript and CSS content. For 12% of these websites, more than half of the content belonging to same-origin sources fails over IPv6, while analytics and third-party advertisements contribute to failures from cross-origin sources. Our results also contribute to the IETF standardisation process. We witness that using an happy eyeballs timer value of 250 ms, clients prefer IPv6 connections to 99% of ALEXA 10 K websites (with AAAA entries) more than 96% of the time. Although, this makes clients prefer slower IPv6 connections in 81% of the cases. Our results show that a Happy Eyeballs (MBA) timer value of 150 ms does not severly affect IPv6 preference towards websites. The entire dataset presenting results on partial failures, latency and HE used in this paper is publicly released.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art151;Electro-Thermal-Mechanical Multiphysics Coupling Failure Analysis Based on Improved IGBT Dynamic Model. Failure of the power device can have a very large impact on the entire power circuit. IGBT as the main power device, ensuring its reliability becomes more and more important. In different environments, there will be large differences in the failure rate of IGBTs. Therefore, studying the failure mechanism of IGBT is of great significance to ensure the reliability of IGBT. Firstly, the IGBT dynamic model is constructed and the model is improved to correct the power consumption error. Then the IGBT finite element model is used to analyze the electro-thermal-force of different material layers, at the same time, the distribution of stress and temperature between different materials are analyzed. Finally, the JavaScript script is used to generate random defects of the solder layer, and the effects of different defects of the solder layer on the weakest part of the IGBT are studied, including voids, cracks, and solder layer falling off. The results of the analysis show that after the IGBT defects reach a certain level, the solder layer voids, the solder layer fall off, and the solder layer cracks have a great influence on the IGBT junction temperature and stress. Among them, shedding and cracks have a greater influence on the stress of the solder layer.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art152;A Large-Scale Study of Android Malware Development Phenomenon on Public Malware Submission and Scanning Platform. With the steady growth of Android malware, we suspect that, during the malware development phase, some Android malware writers use the popular public scanning services (e.g., VirusTotal) for testing the evasion capability of their malware samples, which we name Android malware development cases (AMDs). In this work, we design an AMD hunter in the context of VirusTotal to hunt for AMDs and reveal new threats for Android. First, the AMD hunter sifts through millions of file submissions on VirusTotal efficiently and alert more suspicious submission traces. Second, it performs package level analysis, static code and dynamic analyses on the APKs of the suspicious submissions to validate the AMDs. The implemented hunter has been used in a leading security company for 4 months, which processed 153 million of submissions on VirusTotal, and identified 1,623 AMDs with 13,855 samples from 83 countries. We also performed case studies on 890 malware samples selected from the identified AMDs, which revealed lots of new threats, including the development cases of fake system/banking phishing app, new rooting exploits, new JavaScript based threats, new evasions and AV probing malware. We wrote industry research articles about some AMDs and notified other security vendors to help patch their false negatives. Besides raising the awareness of the existence of AMDs, more importantly, our research provides the first systematic and efficient way to study the malware development phenomenon on VirusTotal. We will share all the samples of the identified AMDs with the research community.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art153;DeepMerge: Learning to Merge Programs. In collaborative software development, program merging is the mechanism to integrate changes from multiple programmers. Merge algorithms in modern version control systems report a conflict when changes interfere textually. Merge conflicts require manual intervention and frequently stall modern continuous integration pipelines. Prior work found that, although costly, a large majority of resolutions involve re-arranging text without writing any new code. Inspired by this observation we propose the first data-driven approach to resolve merge conflicts with a machine learning model. We realize our approach in a tool DeepMerge that uses a novel combination of (i) an edit-aware embedding of merge inputs and (ii) a variation of pointer networks, to construct resolutions from input segments. We also propose an algorithm to localize manual resolutions in a resolved file and employ it to curate a ground-truth dataset comprising 8,719 non-trivial resolutions in JavaScript programs. Our evaluation shows that, on a held out test set, DeepMerge can predict correct resolutions for 37% of non-trivial merges, compared to only 4% by a state-of-the-art semistructured merge technique. Furthermore, on the subset of merges with upto 3 lines (comprising 24% of the total dataset), DeepMerge can predict correct resolutions with 78% accuracy.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art154;Measuring the Global Recursive DNS Infrastructure: A View From the Edge. The Domain Name System (DNS) is one of the most critical Internet subsystems. While the majority of ISPs deploy and operate their own DNS infrastructure, many end users resort to third-party DNS providers with hopes of enhancing their privacy, security, and web performance. However, bad user choices and the uneven geographical deployment of DNS providers could render insecure and inefficient DNS configurations for millions of users. In this paper, we propose a novel and flexible measurement method to (1) study the infrastructure of recursive DNS resolvers, including both ISP's and third-party DNS providers' deployment strategies;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art155;BIPES: Block Based Integrated Platform for Embedded Systems. This article proposes the BIPES, a Block based Integrated Platform for Embedded Systems, including its architecture, design and validation results. BIPES is an open source software and service that is freely available through the website http://www.bipes.net.br and has been conceived from our experience of several years developing embedded systems and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, and teaching. It allows anyone to quickly and reliably design, program, build, deploy and monitor embedded systems, IoT devices and applications using blocks or Python based programming. It is fully based on web environment, so absolutely no software installation is needed on the client developer machine. In this way, a tablet, a netbook, a Chromebook or any other device can be used to program and test several types of devices. Mainly, it relies on MicroPython or CircuitPython, WebREPL, WebSockets, Web Serial API, HTML, JavaScript and Google Blockly to allow no-code programming (blocks) to be translated into Python code and then deployed to the target board. Moreover, it does not require server side processing, so it can be deployed as a Progressive Web Application (PWA), allowing it to be used even when the computer is offline. It is compatible with several low cost boards such as: mBed, BBC micro:bit, ESP8266, ESP32 and Raspberry Pi using only a web browser and without the need to install any software on the device where the user develops the programming.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

art157;Enhancing Web-based Analytics Applications through Provenance. Visual analytics systems continue to integrate new technologies and leverage modern environments for exploration and collaboration, making tools and techniques available to a wide audience through web browsers. Many of these systems have been developed with rich interactions, offering users the opportunity to examine details and explore hypotheses that have not been directly encoded by a designer. Understanding is enhanced when users can replay and revisit the steps in the sensemaking process, and in collaborative settings, it is especially important to be able to review not only the current state but also what decisions were made along the way. Unfortunately, many web-based systems lack the ability to capture such reasoning, and the path to a result is transient, forgotten when a user moves to a new view. This paper explores the requirements to augment existing client-side web applications with support for capturing, reviewing, sharing, and reusing steps in the reasoning process. Furthermore, it considers situations where decisions are made with streaming data, and the insights gained from revisiting those choices when more data is available. It presents a proof of concept, the Shareable Interactive Manipulation Provenance framework (SIMProv.js), that addresses these requirements in a modern, client-side JavaScript library, and describes how it can be integrated with existing frameworks.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art158;Study of JavaScript Static Analysis Tools for Vulnerability Detection in Node.js Packages. With the emergence of the Node.js ecosystem, JavaScript has become a widely used programming language for implementing server-side web applications. In this article, we present the first empirical study of static code analysis tools for detecting vulnerabilities in Node.js code. To conduct a comprehensive tool evaluation, we created the largest known curated dataset of Node.js code vulnerabilities. We characterized and annotated a set of 957 vulnerabilities by analyzing information contained in npm advisory reports. We tested nine different tools and found that many important vulnerabilities appearing in the OWASP top-10 are not detected by any tool. The three best performing tools combined only detect up to 57.6% of all vulnerabilities in the dataset, but at a very low precision of 0.11%. Our curated dataset offers a new benchmark to help characterize existing Node.js code vulnerabilities and foster the development of better vulnerability detection tools for Node.js code.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art159;Moving Real-Time Services to Web 3.0: Challenges and Opportunities. Web 3.0 is an emerging Internet paradigm based predominantly on the blockchain technology. Because Web 3.0 applications are designed to operate over trustless and permissionless networks, they can have significant advantages, such as decentralized control structures and transparency. Hence, existing web applications are being reproduced using Web 3.0 technologies. In contrast, real-time services are still implemented with the Web 2.0 architecture. In particular, implementing Web 3.0 media streaming requires modifications to the service architecture of existing media streaming systems because some technical difficulties exist. For example, as data moves from centralized data centers to distributed storage, the user's quality of experience may be severely degraded. In addition, the software components comprising the Web 3.0 stack, such as interplanetary file system, cryptocurrency wallets, and the Ethereum JavaScript API are not compatible with various combinations of OSs, media players, and browsers. Therefore, in this study, we propose an end-to-end system architecture designed for Web 3.0 real-time services, which prevents degradation of service quality. Further, we present a media NFT marketplace named Retriever (https://retriever.live) fully developed using Web 3.0 technologies. Retriever allows users to enjoy watching video content and further to directly trade their content without intermediaries by ensuring the privacy of the data and managing digital intellectual property. In particular, Retriever does not sacrifice the user experience and is compatible with multiple mobile devices.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art160;A Decision Support System for Diagnostics and Treatment Planning in Traumatic Brain Injury. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurs when an external force causes functional or structural alterations in the brain. Clinical characteristics of TBI vary greatly from patient to patient, and a large amount of data is gathered during various phases of clinical care in these patients. It is hard for clinicians to efficiently integrate and interpret all of these data and plan interventions in a timely manner. This paper describes the technical architecture and functionality of a web-based decision support system (DSS), which not only provides advanced support for visualizing complex TBI data but also predicts a possible outcome by using a state-of-the-art Disease State Index machine-learning algorithm. The DSS is developed by using a three-layered architecture and by employing modern programming principles, software design patterns, and using robust technologies (C#, ASP.NET MVC, HTML5, JavaScript, Entity Framework, etc.). The DSS is comprised of a patient overview module, a disease-state prediction module, and an imaging module. After deploying it on a web-server, the DSS was made available to two hospitals in U.K. and Finland. Afterwards, we conducted a validation study to evaluate its usability in clinical settings. Initial results of the study indicate that especially less experience clinicians may benefit from this type of decision support software tool.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art161;A Secure Medical Information Storage and Sharing Method Based on Multiblockchain Architecture. With the increasing application of technology in the healthcare industry, it has become imperative to establish a robust medical information ecosystem for effective management of medical information secure storage and sharing. This article proposes a healthier ecosystem in collaboration with the main consortium chain and data side chain, using multiblockchain architecture. In the implementation methods for this ecosystem, we store medical information in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format within different side chain structures. Additionally, we introduce an improved Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (PBFT) consensus mechanism based on a point nomination system and a dynamic RBAC access mechanism. By simulating a blockchain environment with multiple nodes, we analyze the efficiency of this method in terms of record retrieval, consensus mechanism, and storage execution time. The results demonstrate that compared to a single chain structure, the proposed method in this article achieves a substantial 30% improvement in query time efficiency. Moreover, the improved PBFT outperforms the traditional PBFT algorithm without dishonest nodes. Medical records stored in JSON format require shorter storage and execution time compared to text format records. This research contributes toward enhancing the security and efficiency of medical information storage and sharing among different medical subject information systems, thereby fostering a healthier healthcare alliance ecosystem.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art162;Improving the Accuracy of Global DEM of Differences (DoD) in Google Earth Engine for 3-D Change Detection Analysis. Digital elevation models (DEMs) represent the geospatial dataset core needed to model 3-D changes. The optimal dataset must be selected according to the environmental phenomenon under investigation as the offered resolution strongly affects the information level. Nonetheless, high-resolution DEMs are not available for the whole earth and, when not at disposal, open-source, medium-resolution, global DEMs may be a relevant source of knowledge. Because of the large amount of data and the vertical accuracy inhomogeneity, their applicability in defining 3-D changes of large areas is not predictable. The aim of this article is to explore global DEMs feasibility in detecting 3-D changes at the global scale and to examine the impact of filtering propagated error on 3-D changes. To achieve these goals, a Javascript code in the Google Earth Engine environment was developed. After recognizing AW3D30 (version 3.2) and NASA SRTM DEM (version 3) as the optimal DEM combination, their DEM of Differences was computed. Such a product was affected by many of Tukey's outliers, subsequently cleaned out. Three different statistical approaches, i.e., limit of detection, uniformly distributed error, and probability map, were compared to avoid artifacts propagating further. All adopted filtering strategies improve the results reliability albeit the third one is the most effective in mountainous, urban, and rural areas. The proposed research shows that the combined use of the two above-mentioned DEMs and appropriate filtering methods allows an effective description of 3-D changes. Moreover, it outlines that such analyses are also possible by using time-saving cloud-computing platforms.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

art164;VisConnect: Distributed Event Synchronization for Collaborative Visualization. Tools and interfaces are increasingly expected to be synchronous and distributed to accommodate remote collaboration. Yet, adoption of these techniques for data visualization is low partly because development is difficult: existing collaboration software systems either do not support simultaneous interaction or require expensive redevelopment of existing visualizations. We contribute VisConnect: a web-based synchronous distributed collaborative visualization system that supports most web-based SVG data visualizations, balances system safety with responsiveness, and supports simultaneous interaction from many collaborators. VisConnect works with existing visualization implementations with little-to-no code changes by synchronizing low-level JavaScript events across clients such that visualization updates proceed transparently across clients. This is accomplished via a peer-to-peer system that establishes consensus among clients on the per-element sequence of events, and uses a lock service to grant access over elements to clients. We contribute collaborative extensions of traditional visualization interaction techniques, such as drag, brush, and lasso, and discuss different strategies for collaborative visualization interactions. To demonstrate the utility of VisConnect, we present novel examples of collaborative visualizations in the healthcare domain, remote collaboration with annotation, and show in an education case study for e-learning with 22 participants that students found the ability to remotely collaborate on class activities helpful and enjoyable for understanding concepts. A free copy of this paper and source code are available on OSF at osf.io/ut7e6 and at visconnect.us.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art165;BridgeTaint: A Bi-Directional Dynamic Taint Tracking Method for JavaScript Bridges in Android Hybrid Applications. Hybrid applications (apps) are becoming more and more popular due to their cross-platform capabilities and high performance. These apps use the JavaScript (JS) bridge communication scheme to interoperate between native code and Web code. Although greatly extending the functionalities of hybrid apps by enabling cross-language invocations and making them more powerful, the bridge communication scheme might also cause some new security issues, e.g., cross-language code injection attacks and privacy leaks. In this paper, we propose BridgeTaint, a bi-directional dynamic taint tracking method that can detect bridge security issues in hybrid apps. BridgeTaint uses a method different from existing ones to track tainted data: it records the taint information of sensitive data when the data are transmitted through the bridge, and uses a cross-language taint mapping method to restore the taint tags of corresponding data. Such a novel design enables BridgeTaint to dynamically track tainted data during the execution of the app and analyze hybrid apps developed using frameworks, which cannot be done with existing solutions based on static code analyses. Based on BridgeTaint, we implement the BridgeInspector tool to detect cross-language privacy leaks and code injection attacks in hybrid apps using JS bridges. A benchmark called BridgeBench is also developed for bridge communication security test. The experimental results on BridgeBench and 1172 apps from Android market demonstrate that BridgeInspector can effectively detect potential privacy leaks and cross-language code injection attacks in hybrid apps using bridge communications.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art166;An Empirical Study of Type-Related Defects in Python Projects. In recent years, Python has experienced an explosive growth in adoption, particularly among open source projects. While Python's dynamically-typed nature provides developers with powerful programming abstractions, that same dynamic type system allows for type-related defects to accumulate in code bases. To aid in the early detection of type-related defects, type annotations were introduced into the Python ecosystem (i.e., PEP-484) and static type checkers like mypy have appeared on the market. While applying a type checker like mypy can in theory help to catch type-related defects before they impact users, little is known about the real impact of adopting a type checker to reveal defects in Python projects. In this paper, we study the extent to which Python projects benefit from such type checking features. For this purpose, we mine the issue tracking and version control repositories of 210 Python projects on GitHub. Inspired by the work of Gao et al. on type-related defects in JavaScript, we add type annotations to test whether mypy detects an error that would have helped developers to avoid real defects. We observe that 15 percent of the defects could have been prevented by mypy. Moreover, we find that there is no significant difference between the experience level of developers committing type-related defects and the experience of developers committing defects that are not type-related. In addition, a manual analysis of the anti-patterns that most commonly lead to type-checking faults reveals that the redefinition of Python references, dynamic attribute initialization and incorrectly handled Null objects are the most common causes of type-related faults. Since our study is conducted on fixed public defects that have gone through code reviews and multiple test cycles, these results represent a lower bound on the benefits of adopting a type checker. Therefore, we recommend incorporating a static type checker like mypy into the development workflow, as not only will it prevent type-related defects but also mitigate certain anti-patterns during development.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art167;Broken External Links on Stack Overflow. Stack Overflow hosts valuable programming-related knowledge with 11,926,354 links that reference to the third-party websites. The links that reference to the resources hosted outside the Stack Overflow websites extend the Stack Overflow knowledge base substantially. However, with the rapid development of programming-related knowledge, many resources hosted on the Internet are not available anymore. Based on our analysis of the Stack Overflow data that was released on Jun. 2, 2019, 14.2 percent of the links on Stack Overflow are broken links. The broken links on Stack Overflow can obstruct viewers from obtaining desired programming-related knowledge, and potentially damage the reputation of the Stack Overflow as viewers might regard the posts with broken links as obsolete. In this paper, we characterize the broken links on Stack Overflow. 65 percent of the broken links in our sampled questions are used to show examples, e.g., code examples. 70 percent of the broken links in our sampled answers are used to provide supporting information, e.g., explaining a certain concept and describing a step to solve a problem. Only 1.67 percent of the posts with broken links are highlighted as such by viewers in the posts‚Äô comments. Only 5.8 percent of the posts with broken links removed the broken links. Viewers cannot fully rely on the vote scores to detect broken links, as broken links are common across posts with different vote scores. The websites that host resources that can be maintained by their users are referenced by broken links the most on Stack Overflow ‚Äì a prominent example of such websites is GitHub. The posts and comments related to the web technologies, i.e., JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and jQuery, are associated with more broken links. Based on our findings, we shed lights for future directions and provide recommendations for practitioners and researchers.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art168;Dynamic Human-in-the-Loop Assertion Generation. Test cases use assertions to check program behaviour. While these assertions may not be complex, they are themselves code that must be written correctly in order to determine whether a test case should pass or fail. We claim that most test assertions are relatively repetitive and straight-forward, making their construction well suited to automation and that this automation can reduce developer effort while improving assertion quality. Examining 33,873 assertions from 105 projects revealed that developer-written assertions fall into twelve high-level categories, confirming that the vast majority ($>$>90%) of test assertions are fairly simple in practice. We created AutoAssert, a human-in-the-loop tool to fit naturally into a developer's test-writing workflow by automatically generating assertions for JavaScript and TypeScript test cases. A developer invokes AutoAssert by identifying the variable they want validated;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art169;Jointly Integrating VCF-Based Variants and OWL-Based Biomedical Ontologies in MongoDB. The development of the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has led to massive amounts of VCF (Variant Call Format) files, which have been the standard formats developed with 1000 Genomes Project. At the same time, with the widespread use of biomedical ontologies in the biomedical community, more and more applications have accepted the Web Ontology Language (OWL) as the dominant data format for the specifications of biomedical ontology descriptions, leading to the rapid growth of OWL-based biomedical ontology scale. In this paper, we seek to explore an effective method for the management of VCF-based genetic variants and OWL-based biological ontologies using the MongoDB database. Considering many current applications (such as the short genetic variations database dbSNP, etc.) are transitioning to the new design by using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) to support future massive data expansion and interchanges. We firstly propose a series of rules for the mapping from VCF and OWL files to JSON files, and then present rule-based algorithms for transforming VCF-based genetic variants and OWL-based biological ontologies into JSON objects. On this basis, we introduce effective approaches of integrating the mapped JSON files in MongoDB. Finally, we complement this work with a set of experiments to show the performance of our proposed approaches. The source code of the proposed approaches could be freely available at https://github.com/lyotvincent/AJIA.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art170;Evaluating the Impact of Possible Dependencies on Architecture-Level Maintainability. Dependencies among software entities are the foundation for much of the research on software architecture analysis and architecture analysis tools. Dynamically typed languages, such as Python, JavaScript and Ruby, tolerate the lack of explicit type references, making certain dependencies indiscernible by a purely syntactic analysis of source code. We call these possible dependencies, in contrast with the explicit dependencies that are directly manifested in source code. We find that existing architecture analysis tools have not taken possible dependencies into consideration. An important question therefore is: to what extent will these missing possible dependencies impact architecture analysis?To answer this question, we conducted a study of 499 open-source Python projects, employing type inference techniques and type hint practices to discern possible dependencies. We investigated the consequences of possible dependencies in three software maintenance contexts, including capturing co-change relations recorded in revision history, measuring architectural maintainability, and detecting architecture anti-patterns that violate design principles and impact maintainability. Our study revealed that the impact of possible dependencies on architecture-level maintainability is substantial‚Äîhigher than that of explicit dependencies. Our findings suggest that architecture analysis and tools should take into account, assess, and highlight the impacts of possible dependencies caused by dynamic typing.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art171;CloudDLP: Transparent and Scalable Data Sanitization for Browser-Based Cloud Storage. Browser-based cloud storage services are still broadly used in enterprises for online sharing and collaboration. However, sensitive information in images or documents may be easily leaked outside trusted enterprise on-premises due to such cloud services. Existing solutions to prevent data leakage in cloud storage services either limit many functionalities of cloud applications or are difficult to be scaled to various cloud applications. In this paper, we propose CloudDLP, a transparent and scalable approach for enterprises to automatically sanitize sensitive data in images and documents with various browser-based cloud applications. CloudDLP is deployed as an internet gateway within the premises of an enterprise using JavaScript injecting techniques and deep learning methods to sanitize sensitive premise data. It neither compromises the user experience nor significantly affects application functionalities in browser-based cloud storage services. We have evaluated CloudDLP with a number of real-world cloud applications. Our experimental results show that it can achieve automatic data sanitization with cloud storage services while preserving most functionalities of cloud applications.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art172;Selection of Best Machine Learning Model to Predict Delay in Passenger Airlines. Over the past years, flight delay has been a critical concern in the aviation sector due to the increased air traffic congestion worldwide. Moreover, it also prolongs the other flights, which can discourage users from traveling with the particular airline. As a result, we proposed a model to predict the overall flight delay using a random forest and path-finding algorithm. The proposed model focuses on searching flights (can be nonstop or connecting) between the source and destination at the earliest. The proposed model identifies the fastest flights between source and destination based on the input by the user using some open source/public Application Programming Interface (APIs), which are further inserted into Neo4j to convert it into a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. Finally, the experimental results on the real-time data set show the proposed model‚Äôs effectiveness compared to the state-of-the-art models. The results and analysis yield an accuracy of 98.2% for delay prediction on historical data using the random forest algorithm.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art173;RiceMapEngine: A Google Earth Engine-Based Web Application for Fast Paddy Rice Mapping. Mapping rice area is a critical resource planning task in many South Asia countries where rice is the primary crop. Remote-sensing-based methods typically rely on domain knowledge, such as crop calendar and crop phenology, and supervised classification with ground truth samples. Applying such methods on Google Earth engine (GEE) has been proven effective, especially at large scale owing to the comprehensive and up-to-date data catalog and massive server-side processing power. However, writing scripts through the code editor requires users to program in JavaScript and understand GEE application programming interface (API), which can be challenging for many researchers. Thus, this article presents a GEE-based web application that aims to eliminate the programming requirements for data selection, preprocessing, and visualizations so that users can easily produce rice maps and refine ground truth collections through intuitive graphical user interfaces (GUI). This software includes three submodule apps, namely the ground truth collection app, threshold-based rice mapping app, and classification-based rice mapping app. Users can customize data processing flow using GUI designed with Bootstrap, and the backend server uses GEE Python API, and a Google service account for authentication to execute the workflow on Google cloud servers. The experiment shows that both the overall accuracy and Kappa scores of the mapping result are higher than 0.9, which suggests that RiceMapEngine can significantly reduce the complexity and time costs it takes to produce the accurate rice area maps and meet the demands of real-world stakeholders.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art174;A Methodology for Analyzing Uptake of Software Technologies Among Developers. Motivation: The question of what combination of attributes drives the adoption of a particular software technology is critical to developers. It determines both those technologies that receive wide support from the community and those which may be abandoned, thus rendering developers‚Äô investments worthless. Aim and Context: We model software technology adoption by developers and provide insights on specific technology attributes that are associated with better visibility among alternative technologies. Thus, our findings have practical value for developers seeking to increase the adoption rate of their products. Approach: We leverage social contagion theory and statistical modeling to identify, define, and test empirically measures that are likely to affect software adoption. More specifically, we leverage a large collection of open source version control repositories (containing over 4 billion unique versions) to construct a software dependency chain for a specific set of R language source-code files. We formulate logistic regression models, where developers‚Äô software library choices are modeled, to investigate the combination of technological attributes that drive adoption among competing data frame (a core concept for a data science languages) implementations in the R language: tidy and data.table. To describe each technology, we quantify key project attributes that might affect adoption (e.g., response times to raised issues, overall deployments, number of open defects, knowledge base) and also characteristics of developers making the selection (performance needs, scale, and their social network). Results: We find that a quick response to raised issues, a larger number of overall deployments, and a larger number of high-score StackExchange questions are associated with higher adoption. Decision makers tend to adopt the technology that is closer to them in the technical dependency network and in author collaborations networks while meeting their performance needs. To gauge the generalizability of the proposed methodology, we investigate the spread of two popular web JavaScript frameworks Angular and React, and discuss the results. Future work: We hope that our methodology encompassing social contagion that captures both rational and irrational preferences and the elucidation of key measures from large collections of version control data provides a general path toward increasing visibility, driving better informed decisions, and producing more sustainable and widely adopted software.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art175;MMPD: A Novel Malicious PDF File Detector for Mobile Robots. PDF is one of the most commonly used office tools, and can be used by robots to share documents with people. However, it has become the target of hackers to attack a variety of devices since it is cross-platform and can be embed with JavaScript code or URIs. Therefore, how to protect the platform security while robots parsing PDF files becomes a serious problem. In this paper, we design and realize a novel malicious PDF file detector, MMPD, for mobile robots based on deep learning. Experiments show that the F1-Score of MMPD can achieve up to 99.478%. In the meantime, the hardware resource usage is low and no significant performance reduction of the whole system is observed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art176;Hidden Path: Understanding the Intermediary in Malicious Redirections. URL redirection has become an important tool for adversaries to cover up their malicious campaigns. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale measurement study on how adversaries leverage URL redirection to circumvent security checks and distribute malicious content in practice. To this end, we design an iteratively running framework to mine the domains used for malicious redirections constantly. First, we use a bipartite graph-based method to dig out the domains potentially involved in malicious redirections from real-world DNS traffic. Then, we dynamically crawl these suspicious domains and recover the corresponding redirection chains from the crawler‚Äôs performance log. Based on the collected redirection chains, we analyze the working mechanism of various malicious redirections, involving the abused modes and methods, and highlight the pervasiveness of node sharing. Notably, we find a new redirection abuse, redirection fluxing, which is abused to enhance the concealment of malicious sites by introducing randomness into the redirection. Our case studies reveal the adversary‚Äôs preference for abusing JavaScript methods to conduct redirection, even by introducing time-delay and fabricating user clicks to simulate normal users.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art177;WebProfiler: User Interaction Prediction Framework for Web Applications. User interaction prediction for Web applications is crucial to improve browsing experience. With the prediction, for instance, a browser can prefetch the content to be accessed next reducing long wait times in advance. However, predicting the user interaction is challenging in practice. Collecting detailed interaction data is difficult due to the constraints on target application and platform. Moreover, Web navigation prediction mechanisms for general applications have a low accuracy with conventional machine learning models. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Web interaction profiling framework, WebProfiler, which collects user interaction data in a generic way and accurately predicts the next navigation. Both navigation and click events are collected by using JavaScript event handlers and clicked objects are identified reliably through a document object model based approach. Furthermore, we adopt gated recurrent unit (GRU), a representative deep learning technique suitable for coping with time series Web interaction data, and present two advanced techniques for training the GRU-based model: uniform resource locator (URL) grouping to handle the variant URLs of a Web page and Web embedding to represent both events in a unified vector space. The experimental results based on the real user interaction data showed that click events within an application improved the overall prediction performance by 13.7% on average, which were overlooked by most of the previous research. In addition, WebProfiler achieved an average F-measure of 0.798 for top three candidates where URL grouping and Web embedding contributed to 52.4% of the performance improvement.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art178;A System-Level Simulation Module for Multi-UAV IRS-Assisted Communications. Sixth-Generation (6G) networks are set to provide reliable, widespread, and ultra-low-latency mobile broadband communications for a variety of industries. In this regard, the Internet of Drones (IoD) represents a key component for the development of 3D networks, which envisions the integration of terrestrial and non-terrestrial infrastructures. The recent employment of Intelligent Reflective Surfaces (IRSs) in combination with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) introduces more degrees of freedom to achieve a flexible and prompt mobile coverage. As the concept of smart radio environment is gaining momentum across the scientific community, this work proposes an extension module for Internet of Drones Simulator (IoD-Sim), a comprehensive simulation platform for the IoD, based on Network Simulator 3 (ns-3). This module is purposefully designed to assess the performance of UAV-aided IRS-assisted communication systems. Starting from the mathematical formulation of the radio channel, the simulator implements the IRS as a peripheral that can be attached to a drone. Such device can be dynamically configured to organize the IRS into patches and assign them to assist the communication between two nodes. Furthermore, the extension relies on the configuration facilities of IoD-Sim, which greatly eases design and coding of scenarios in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) language. A simulation campaign is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposal by discussing several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as Radio Environment Map (REM), Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), maximum achievable rate, and average throughput.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art179;Detection of Infection Sources for Avian Influenza A(H7N9) in Live Poultry Transport Network During the Fifth Wave in China. Numerous studies have demonstrated that exposure to live poultry or live poultry markets is the significant risk factor for human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9). However, the specific live poultry markets that are major infection sources for A(H7N9) human cases have not been explored in detail. In this study, we extract data associated with poultry farms, live poultry markets and farmers' markets from Baidu Map using the JavaScript language and then construct the live poultry transport network. From this, we establish our A(H7N9) transmission model over the network based upon probabilistic discrete-time Markov chain. On the basis of the obtained network and model, we propose spatiotemporal backward detection and forward transmission algorithms to detect the most likely infection sources and to compute the first arrival times of the infection sources. Our simulations use these algorithms to identify the specific locations of the infection sources, the first arrival times of the infection sources and the most likely transmission map of the A(H7N9) virus along the live poultry transport network. The results reveal that, in addition to the hazards posed by the live poultry markets, backyard poultry also contributed to A(H7N9) human infections;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art180;Audio and Video Mixing Method to Enhance WebRTC. The WebRTC protocol can provide live streaming of peer-to-peer connections via JavaScript (JS) application programming interface (API) calls to a web browser. However, the protocol is restricted to a small number of peers because there is no simple way to mix real-time streams from multiple peers and then distribute the mixed stream to a large number of audiences. For example, it is necessary to mix audio and video streams from peers in a conversation and broadcast the real-time mixed stream to more than 10k audiences who only watch the video. It is also necessary to blend synchronous content (e.g., logos, music) to the live conversation stream. WebRTC does not currently provide a mechanism to easily support these cases. This paper proposes a method for the synchronized mixing of real-time audio/video streams from multiple peers while minimizing latency. This method enables the implementation of an online live conversation system that is able to mix live conversation streams from multiple peers and then rebroadcast the mixed stream to a large number of audiences.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art181;CryptojackingTrap: An Evasion Resilient Nature-Inspired Algorithm to Detect Cryptojacking Malware. The high profitability of mining cryptocurrencies mining, a computationally intensive activity, forms a fertile ecosystem that is enticing not only legitimate investors but also cyber attackers who invest their illicit computational resources in this area. Cryptojacking refers to the surreptitious exploitation of a victim‚Äôs computing resources to mine cryptocurrencies on behalf of the cyber-criminal. This malicious behavior is observed in executable files and browser executable codes, including JavaScript and Assembly modules, downloaded from websites to victims‚Äô machines and executed. Although there are numerous botnet detection techniques to stop this malicious activity, attackers can circumvent these protections using a variety of techniques. In this paper, CryptojackingTrap is presented as a novel cryptojacking detection solution designed to resist most malware defense methods. The CryptojackingTrap is armed with a debugger and extensible cryptocurrency listeners and its algorithm is based on the execution of cryptocurrency hash functions: an indispensable behavior of all cryptojacking executors. This algorithm becomes aware of this specific hash execution by correlating the memory access traces of suspicious executables with publicly available cryptocurrency P2P network data. With the advantage of this assembly-level investigation and a nature-inspired approach to triggering the detection alarm, CryptojackingTrap provides an accurate, evasion-proof technique for detecting cryptojacking. After experimental evaluation, the false negative and false positive rates are zero, and in addition, the false positive rate is mathematically calculated as 10‚àí20. CryptojackingTrap has an open, extensible architecture and is available to the open-source community.;art; cross-country relationship network;" external HR approach) that could facilitate effective discovery and nurturing of local talent.

art182;$\tau\text{JOWL}$: A Systematic Approach to Build and Evolve a Temporal OWL 2 Ontology Based on Temporal JSON Big Data. Nowadays, ontologies, which are defined under the OWL 2 Web Ontology Language (OWL 2), are being used in several fields like artificial intelligence, knowledge engineering, and Semantic Web environments to access data, answer queries, or infer new knowledge. In particular, ontologies can be used to model the semantics of big data as an enabling factor for the deployment of intelligent analytics. Big data are being widely stored and exchanged in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, in particular by Web applications. However, JSON data collections lack explicit semantics as they are in general schema-less, which does not allow to efficiently leverage the benefits of big data. Furthermore, several applications require bookkeeping of the entire history of big data changes, for which no support is provided by mainstream Big Data management systems, including Not only SQL (NoSQL) database systems. In this paper, we propose an approach, named $\tau \text{JOWL}$ (temporal OWL 2 from temporal JSON), which allows users (i) to automatically build a temporal OWL 2 ontology of data, following the Closed World Assumption (CWA), from temporal JSON-based big data, and (ii) to manage its incremental maintenance accommodating the evolution of these data, in a temporal and multi-schema environment.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art183;MiniTracker: Large-Scale Sensitive Information Tracking in Mini Apps. Running on host mobile applications, mini apps have gained increasing popularity these days for its convenience in installation and usage. However, being easy to use allows mini apps to freely access a large amount of user information, mostly without close inspection of privacy violations. Hence it becomes a crucial issue to automatically track sensitive flows in mini apps. Although flow analysis has been widely studied, unique challenges emerge: the analysis tool should not only handle mini app-specific features such as flows that interweave between rendering and logic, and asynchronous executions, but also deal with problems raised by Javascript development: the performance tradeoff between precision and efficiency, and function aliases. To this end, we propose MiniTracker, an automatic sensitive flow tracking tool which well handles mini app features, constructs assignment flow graphs as common representation across different host apps, searches function aliases, and analyzes the graph by property chains. We show our design choices achieve a sweet spot in the tradeoff between precision and efficiency, with superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art. We also perform a large-scale study on 150 k mini apps, which reveals the common leakage patterns and offers insights into the privacy threats of mini apps.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art184;MoMIT: Porting a JavaScript Interpreter on a Quarter Coin. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical, connected devices providing services through private networks and the Internet. The devices connect through the Internet to Web servers and other devices. One of the popular programming languages for communicating Web pages and Web apps is JavaScript (JS). Hence, the devices would benefit from JS apps. However, porting JS apps to the many IoT devices, e.g., System-on-a-Chip (SoCs) devices (e.g., Arduino Uno), is challenging because of their limited memory, storage, and CPU capabilities. Also, some devices may lack hardware/software capabilities for running JS apps ‚Äúas is‚Äù. Thus, we propose MoMIT, a multiobjective optimization approach to miniaturize JS apps to run on IoT devices. We implement MoMIT using three different search algorithms. We miniaturize a JS interpreter and measure the characteristics of 23 apps before/after applying MoMIT. We find reductions of code size, memory usage, and CPU time of 31, 56, and 36 percent, respectively (medians). We show that MoMIT allows apps to run on up to two additional devices in comparison to the original JS interpreter.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art185;Modern Web Frameworks: A Comparison of Rendering Performance. Recent years have seen the rise of a new generation of UI frameworks for web application development. These frameworks differ from previous generations of JavaScript frameworks in that they define a declarative application development model, where transitions in the state of the UI are managed by the framework. This potentially greatly simplifies application development, but requires the framework to implement a rendering strategy which translates changes in application state into changes in the state of the UI. The performance characteristics of these rendering strategies have thus far been poorly studied. In this article, we describe the rendering strategies used in the frameworks Angular, React, Vue, Svelte and Blazor, which represent some of the most influential and widely used modern web frameworks. We find significant differences in the scaling of costs in their rendering strategies with potentially equally significant practical performance implications. To verify these differences, we implement a number of benchmarks that measure the scaling of rendering costs as an application grows in complexity. The results of our benchmarks confirm that under certain circumstances, performance differences between frameworks can range up to several orders of magnitude when performing the same tasks. Furthermore, we find that the relative performance of a rendering strategy can be effectively estimated based on factors affecting the input sizes of render loops. The best performing rendering strategies are found to be ones which minimize input sizes using techniques such as compile-time optimization and reactive programming models.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art186;Students' Online Laboratory Work Assessment Based on Learning Task Lists and Behavior Data. In conventional laboratories, engineering students must attend in person to conduct experiments with real equipment in a physical place, where their work is mainly assessed through self-reports and attendance records. By comparison, online labs can record and analyze students' activities and behaviors automatically. Thus, this article proposes a novel method for assessing students' online laboratory work. The assessment method has two key components. The first component considers the scores provided by a task learning system, with progressive task lists set to guide students to finish the experiments. After each subtask, the completeness and quality are verified, and the system automatically records the corresponding score according to checking rules executed through JavaScript codes. The second part analyzes the behavior data, and student performance during the online experiments is analyzed using a fuzzy inference method. This work also presents a case study based on practical teaching at Wuhan University, where students in the courses Classical Control Theory and System Identification use the networked control system laboratory for their laboratory courses. The results show that the proposed assessment method can be applied to effectively and automatically evaluate students' laboratory work.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art187;A Transformational Approach to Managing Data Model Evolution of Web Services. The communication of web services is typically organized through public APIs, which rely on a common data model shared among all system components. Over time, this data model must be changed in order to accommodate new or changing requirements, and the system components including the data they are operating on must be migrated. In practice, however, not all the affected components can be migrated instantly and at the same time. A common approach is to plan data model changes in a backward compatible fashion, which eventually causes serious maintenance problems and is a common cause of technical debt. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution to this problem by using a translation layer serving as a round-trip migration service which is responsible for the lossless forth-and-back translation of object-oriented data model instances of different versions. We present a framework which offers a version-aware interface definition language (IDL) for APIs, a typed JavaScript-based language for defining migration functions using the IDL definition, and a run-time environment for executing migrations. This is bundled into an integrated development environment assisting developers in implementing migration functions. From a methodological point of view, the development of round-trip migrations is supported by a catalog which comprises a set of typical data model evolution scenarios along with corresponding suitable round-trip migration strategies. We validate our framework by carrying out an extensive evaluation including a systematic assessment of expressiveness using our catalog, micro-benchmarking the performance of round-trip migrations, as well as a practical application in a case study of a real-world e-commerce web application obtained from an industrial partner.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art188;Enhancing SEO in Single-Page Web Applications in Contrast With Multi-Page Applications. This paper comprehensively reviews methods for improving single-page applications‚Äô visibility (SPAs) and user experience, focusing on the intricacies of search engine optimisation (SEO). This research contrasts the complexities and challenges in optimising SEO in SPAs instead of conventional multi-page applications (MPAs). It identifies vital optimisation methods and evaluates their applicability in the contemporary web landscape. The research method involves implementing the explored optimisation techniques across three distinct projects utilising emerging technologies for SPA, MPA, and a hybrid approach using Isomorphic JavaScript. These applications are systematically examined and subjected to a comparative analysis to assess the effectiveness of the optimisation strategies before and after applying the optimisation strategies. The empirical results substantiate that adopting an innovative approach to Client-Side rendering for the initial page load, combined with traditional SEO practices, performance enhancements, and tailored methodologies for specific technologies, facilitates SEO optimisation in SPAs at a level commensurate with MPAs. The findings of this work hold significant implications for web developers, offering insights and actionable strategies to augment visibility and performance in search engine results. By bridging the theoretical understanding with hands-on application and empirical analysis, the research contributes to the evolving field of web application development. It underscores the critical role of SEO optimisation in the context of SPAs, highlighting its importance for search engine rankings and overall user engagement and satisfaction.

art189;BrowVis: Visualizing Large Graphs in the Browser. A recent stream of research focuses on building high-performance data analysis and management systems that run completely in the browser. Indeed, today personal devices offer non-trivial amount of computing power, while the latest Web browsers provide powerful JavaScript engines. On the other hand, the use of visualization to present and analyze networks is taking a leading role in conveying information and knowledge to users that operate in multiple domains. In this scenario, the aim of our research is to explore the scalability limits of a system that executes the full graph visualization pipeline entirely in the browser. In this paper, we present BrowVis, a self-contained system to compute interactive visualizations of large graphs in the browser. Experiments show that, on a common laptop, BrowVis can visualize graphs with thousands of elements in seconds, as well as graphs with millions of elements in minutes. Once the initial visualization has been computed, BrowVis makes it possible to interactively explore the represented graph by following a details-on-demand paradigm. The use of BrowVis in practice is demonstrated by a case study dealing with a real-world scientific collaboration network.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art190;œÑSQWRL: A TSQL2-Like Query Language for Temporal Ontologies Generated from JSON Big Data. Temporal ontologies allow to represent not only concepts, their properties, and their relationships, but also time-varying information through explicit versioning of definitions or through the four-dimensional perdurantist view. They are widely used to formally represent temporal data semantics in several applications belonging to different fields (e.g., Semantic Web, expert systems, knowledge bases, big data, and artificial intelligence). They facilitate temporal knowledge representation and discovery, with the support of temporal data querying and reasoning. However, there is no standard or consensual temporal ontology query language. In a previous work, we have proposed an approach named œÑJOWL (temporal OWL 2 from temporal JSON, where OWL 2 stands for ‚ÄúOWL 2 Web Ontology Language‚Äù and JSON stands for ‚ÄúJavaScript Object Notation‚Äù). œÑJOWL allows (1) to automatically build a temporal OWL 2 ontology of data, following the Closed World Assumption (CWA), from temporal JSON-based big data, and (2) to manage its incremental maintenance accommodating their evolution, in a temporal and multi-schema-version environment. In this paper, we propose a temporal ontology query language for rJOWL, named rSQWRL (temporal SQWRL), designed as a temporal extension of the ontology query language-Semantic Query-enhanced Web Rule Language (SQWRL). The new language has been inspired by the features of the consensual temporal query language TSQL2 (Temporal SQL2), well known in the temporal (relational) database community. The aim of the proposal is to enable and simplify the task of retrieving any desired ontology version or of specifying any (complex) temporal query on time-varying ontologies generated from time-varying big data. Some examples, in the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) domain, are provided to motivate and illustrate our proposal.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art191;Asynchronous Remote Usability Tests Using Web-Based Tools Versus Laboratory Usability Tests: An Experimental Study. Remote usability testing is performed by evaluators who are in different physical locations from the participants (synchronous remote testing) and possibly operating at different times (asynchronous remote testing). The tools developed in recent years to support remote tests exploit web technology based on HTML5 and JavaScript ES6 and thus enable previously unexplored scenarios. However, studies providing evidence on the benefits or drawbacks of utilizing recent web-based tools have not yet been reported in the literature. This article sheds some light on the impact of such tools on asynchronous remote usability testing of websites by reporting an experimental study with 100 participants and 15 evaluators to compare real-time laboratory tests with asynchronous remote tests. The study investigates: 1) how the metrics results of asynchronous remote usability tests performed through a web-based tool differ from those of usability tests conducted in real-time laboratory settings;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
art192;Properties and Styles of Software Technology Tutorials. A large number of tutorials for popular software development technologies are available online, and those about the same technology vary widely in their presentation. We studied the design of tutorials in the software documentation landscape for five popular programming languages: Java, C#, Python, Javascript, and Typescript. We investigated the extent to which tutorial pages, i.e. resources, differ and report statistics of variations in resource properties. We developed a framework for characterizing resources based on their distinguishing attributes, i.e. properties that vary widely for the resource, relative to other resources. Additionally, we propose that a resource can be represented by its resource style, i.e. the combination of its distinguishing attributes. We discuss three techniques for characterizing resources based on our framework, to capture notable and relevant content and presentation properties of tutorial pages. We apply these techniques on a data set of 2551 resources to validate that our framework identifies valid and interpretable styles. We contribute this framework for reasoning about the design of resources in the online software documentation landscape.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1080/09585192.2021.1953565;Boundaryless careers and algorithmic constraints in the gig economy. With low barriers to entry and ease of access to work, the gig economy offers the prospect of boundaryless opportunities for flexible working arrangements characterised by increased autonomy. This form of work, however, may leave individuals without development opportunities and could stymie career progression. Drawing on boundaryless career theory, this study examines the potential of gig workers to develop the transferable career competencies required to effectively pursue opportunities beyond these precarious roles. Through insights from 56 gig worker interviews, we analyse the lived experiences of workers in attempting to develop 'knowing-why', 'knowing-how', and 'knowing-whom' competencies. In so doing, we find that the potentially unmovable boundaries posed by algorithmic management practices within platform organisations constrains workers' abilities to navigate their roles and develop transferable competencies. The study lends empirical support to the bounded effect of gig work on individuals' careers in a domain characterised by precarity where organisations dismiss the existence of an employment relationship, where individuals may simultaneously work for multiple platforms, and where secretive algorithms heavily influence the experience of work.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1080/09585192.2018.1528472;Retaining repatriates-the role of career derailment upon repatriation and how it can be mitigated. This study draws on relative deprivation theory to investigate the effect of career derailment upon return from an international assignment on repatriate retention, thereby also considering factors which can mitigate this relationship. The results from a hierarchical linear regression analysis of data from 292 repatriates indicate that career derailment upon repatriation decreases the former expatriates' intent to stay. However, this effect is weaker when individuals perceived that they had promotion, autonomy and compensation advantages relative to colleagues who lack international assignment experience and when they were provided organizational repatriation support by their assigning organization. With these findings, this work lays the ground for strategies to improve the retention of former expatriates despite restricted career opportunities in the home organization. Thereby, it helps firms to realize the long-term benefits of international assignments.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2401580;Organizational on-boarding practices and shifts in alcohol misuse among at-risk college recruits. With a significant proportion of college students in many countries engaging in risky drinking behavior, this study examines the tendency of such young adults to 'mature out' of such behavior in their first year of employment after graduating, and the degree to which three mainstream organizational on-boarding experiences may expedite such 'maturing out'. Focusing on newcomers' experiences with alcohol-oriented job orientation, job empowerment, and organizational efforts to facilitate the development of supportive peer relationships, we test hypotheses regarding the direct effects of time on the change in alcohol misuse among those reporting misuse in college, as well as the degree to which individual on-boarding experiences account for the variance in young adults' maturing out trajectories over the course of their first year of employment. Findings generated from data collected from over 400 young adults over multiple waves offer important theoretical and practical implications regarding how and why particular onboarding tactics may be more or less effective in influencing newcomers' health-related behaviors.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2237864;Building (and breaking) a vicious cycle formed by extreme working conditions, work intensification, and perceived well-being: a study of dirty workers in Brazilian favelas. This study aims to understand how extreme working conditions, work intensification, and employee well-being are related in the context of dirty work. We conducted a grounded theory study through interviews with 57 workers in so called 'dirty jobs' who are tasked with cutting off electricity in Brazilian favelas. Our model showed that, when working in extreme conditions, dirty workers seek to build more positive meanings in relation to their professional occupation as a way of collectively reacting to the negative judgments they receive. This process leads them to identify more with their work role, to work more intensely, and to experience a sense of well-being at work. With that, they also accept and even want to continue to work in extreme conditions. However, when workers experience situations in which their sense of self is threatened, they reject being subjected to extreme working conditions and limit the intensity of their work.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Supervisor control behavior and support behavior have each been shown to be associated with telecommuter work outcomes. Based on Job Demands-Resources model, we tested the joint effects of these supervisor behaviors in predicting telecommuters' self-regulation at work and subsequent work outcomes (task performance and helping behavior). Full-time telecommuters (N = 303) completed online questionnaires about their work situation. Results of polynomial regression analyses supported the hypothesized mediation model. Telecommuters reported higher self-regulation at work and better work outcomes when supervisors showed high congruence in control and support, compared to those whose supervisors showed low congruence in their behavior. Further, when there was incongruence in supervisor behaviors, telecommuters' outcomes were better when supervisor support was higher than control than when control was higher than support. Our findings have theoretical and practical implications for how to be an effective remote leader in Times of Crisis like COVID-19. Limitations and future directions are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2075234;From wallflower to life and soul of the party: acknowledging time's role at center stage in the study of careers. The point of departure for this paper is the observation that time is central to the study of careers, although research on time and careers is not easy to do and is expensive. The paper does not attempt to minimize these practical difficulties, but nevertheless suggests new ways forward for time-based careers research. First, we review the reasons for time playing such a central role in the study of careers. Next, we examine the approach scholars from other disciplines, ranging from philosophy to organization studies, have taken to the study of time, drawing out a number of anchor points that, we suggest, form the basis for a new research agenda for career studies. Finally, we develop idea for this agenda across three broad themes, to do with conceptual issues, methodological issues, and areas of study that could fruitfully be opened up.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1991433;When and how does ambidextrous leadership influences voice? The roles of leader-subordinate gender similarity and employee emotional expression. In recent years, employee voice has become a popular topic in organizational behavior research. However, existing research has failed to explore when and how ambidextrous leadership influences voice. Adopting leader-member exchange theory and person-environment fit theory, we constructed a moderated mediation model and analyzed the influential path and boundary of ambidextrous leadership on employee voice on the basis of gender similarity between leaders and subordinates. To test our conceptual model, we collected sample in three phases at a monthly interval from multiple employees and their direct leaders from China. Drawing on a paired questionnaire survey of 43 leaders and 182 subordinates, we tested our conceptual model by using polynomial regression analysis, hierarchical regression, and bootstrapping methods. Results reveal that (1) ambidextrous leadership has a positive effect on employee voice;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2019.1629985;Linking career success motives and career boundaries to repatriates' turnover intentions: A case study. This study's goal is to understand repatriates' personal experiences about their career success motives in the years following an international assignment and how that may prompt turnover intentions. The case study comprises data from 8 Portuguese companies belonging to different industries. Overall, we interviewed 42 repatriates and 17 human resource organizational representatives. Building on career success literature, this study's findings show that these repatriates' main career-pull motives to stay with the organization are related to (1) Recognition and Affection, (2) Financial and Employment Security, (3) Developmental Career Opportunities, (4) and, lastly, Career Advancement. By comparison, these repatriates' career-push motives to leave pertain to (1) the Lack of Developmental Career Opportunities, (2) Financial and Employment Insecurity, and (3) Recognition and Affection Breach. Furthermore, the findings shed new light on the role played by contextual-structural career boundaries as a mitigating factor in repatriates' turnover intentions. Overall, we add a new contribution to the literature on career success and repatriation by showing that Affective career success motives (both Intra-Inter-Personal) are, on the whole, more important than Achievement career success motives in these repatriates' turnover intentions.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1964571;Responsible leadership during international assignments: a novel approach toward expatriation success. Adopting a responsible leadership (RL) lens and drawing on intergroup behavior and social identity theory, we analyze a sample of 111 expatriates using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Our findings indicate that RL enacted by host-country supervisors is positively associated with international assignees' cross-cultural adjustment and affective well-being at work, in turn leading to better expatriate performance. RL may thus facilitate adjustment and well-being in the host country. We emphasize the support potential when expatriates' supervisors are guided by a strong values foundation and exhibit stakeholder engagement. In this way, we aim to provide a perspective for studying leadership dynamics in the expatriation context that goes beyond leader-follower dyads within organizations. We believe that expatriation research can benefit from adopting a broader stakeholder view on leadership that considers business-society interrelations and outline some direction that might take.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1943490;Performance implications of the HR business partner model and the mediating role of internal efficiency: a comparison between Germany and the United Kingdom. Ulrich's framework of the human resource business partner model (HRBPM) suggests that both the strategic HRM roles (i.e. strategic partner and change agent) and operational HRM roles (i.e. administrative expert and employee champion) jointly add value to an organization. To deepen our understanding of the link between the HRBPM and organizational performance, this study jointly examines the influence of strategic and operational roles on organizational performance and introduces internal efficiency as a central mediating mechanism that explains how the HRBPM contributes to organizational success. In addition, we offer an institutional perspective on the HRBPM to improve our understanding of how the HRBPM is designed in different institutional contexts and whether the performance implications depend on the organization's institutional environment. Based on data from 300 medium-sized and large organizations from Germany and the UK, we found a joint impact of the HRM roles on organizational performance, mediated by internal efficiency. We also found differences in the design of the HRBPM between the UK and Germany;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1937276;Managing talent in mission-driven organizations: a qualitative exploration. Although there is fruitful talent management (TM) literature on large private companies, little of the TM research examines mission-driven organizations (MDOs). This study addresses this gap by presenting TM in the context of the not-for-profit sector in Russia. Using grounded theory, we interviewed 34 top managers to understand how they define talent and how they manage such talent. The research highlights the crucial role of social values in this context. It generates a perspective on the definition of talent that differs from that of the traditional TM literature. The variety of talent definitions creates the following three different paths for TM: community-based, innovation and learning-based, and security and status-based. Then, we derive from these paths three patterns of TM practices (managerial, entrepreneurial and amateur) that describe the TM practices among Russian MDOs. This study contributes to the TM literature by challenging the traditional approach to TM that focuses on large private companies in Western countries. This paper links TM with social and moral values and presents three different TM patterns, which might be helpful for CEOs, executives and TM managers.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1080/09585192.2018.1513413;The Toyota Way or the unions' way?: Examining the nexus between lean and unions in Toyota Australia. An earlier special issue of this journal (Vol. 25, Issue 21, 2014), focused on the use of the lean model in developed countries. The authors of the introductory article (Bamber, Stanton, Bartram and Ballardie, 2014, pp. 2881-2891) observed that lean in an employment relations-unionist paradigm is relatively an under researched area, despite several organizations attempting to introduce lean being unionized. Resultantly, two broad themes they identified for further research, included the relationship between lean and employee unions, and the involvement of unions in the implementation of lean. This article addresses these themes by paying attention to an actual case study of the attempts made by the Japanese automotive giant Toyota, to establish its customized lean model within its unionized Australian affiliate TMCA (Toyota Motor Corporation Australia), during the period 1959-2015. The findings suggest that there is an acrimonious relationship between lean and the unions - as evidenced by Australia's strong manufacturing unions that posed significant challenges to Toyota's efficacious implementation of lean practices - and concur with a few of the key reasons that informed the decision taken by the company's top management in 2014 to cease their Australian manufacturing operations by 2017.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1891114;Rebooting employees: upskilling for artificial intelligence in multinational corporations. Proponents of artificial intelligence (AI) have envisaged a scenario wherein intelligent machines would execute routine tasks performed by humans, thus, relieving them to engage in creative pursuits. While there is widespread fear of corresponding job losses, organizational think tanks vouch for the synergistic culmination of human-machine competencies. Using the dynamic skill, neo-human capital and AI job replacement theories, we contend that the introduction and adoption of AI calls for employees to upskill themselves. To determine the key skills deemed critical for the upskilling of employees, we interviewed 20 experienced professionals in multinational corporations (MNCs) in the information technology sector in India. Deploying Gioia's methodology for qualitative analysis, our investigation revealed five critical skills for employee upskilling: data analysis, digital, complex cognitive, decision making and continuous learning skills.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1879207;Managing furloughs: how furlough policy and perceptions of fairness impact turnover intentions over time. Given the increasing application of cutback strategies in the workplace, and an underlying need to understand explanatory process at work, we investigated the effects of one cutback strategy to deal with economic uncertainty - furloughs. Equity theory and social exchange theory guided our predictions in explaining the mechanisms through which furloughs affect turnover intentions. Quantitative data collected at two time periods during the Great Recession, after cutbacks were announced and implemented, provided evidence that assessments of psychological contract breach and work overload affect the relationship between furlough experience and turnover intentions. To investigate how the additional stressors of a pandemic affected the proposed model, a follow-up content analysis of employee discussions around cutback policies during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted. This analysis provided support for the model, and also identifies several additional themes brought on by the pandemic (trust, and health and safety), with many employees exhibiting feelings of anxiety and fear around cutback policies and the status of their employment in general. Our results have implications for many organizational cutback initiatives, including salary reductions and decreased organizational resources, that are implemented during times of crisis.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2386354;You can't win with them all. The impact of organizational cultures of difference on the organizational quality of life. It is now widely recognised that a 'good' diversity management (DM) is crucial for promoting organisational innovation and well-being. However, recent evidence shows diversity management (DM) often doesn't guarantee the desired results. We assumed DM could be hindered when the underlying organisational culture of difference (OCD) does not authentically legitimise diversity. Thus, OCD is the sediment of the organisational assumption about diversity that defines dynamics at a deep level and determines the everyday 'field' into which all DM proposals 'land'. Assuming that only an OCD that authentically recognises diversity as an intrinsic worth can provide a positive impact through DM, we investigated the impact that different OCDs can have on the organisational quality of life. A total of 3.247 questionnaires were collected. Data were analysed in aggregate form using ANOVA and MANOVA through SPSS. Results supported our assumption: OCDs have a statistically significant impact on organisational quality of life;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2353660;How do tangible and intangible rewards encourage employee voice? The perspective of dual proactive motivational pathways. Finding ways to motivate employees to speak up with suggestions and concerns is an important organizational concern. Drawing on the proactive motivation model, this research examines how organizational reward practices can encourage employee voice. We investigate whether tangible rewards (e.g. bonuses, pay increases, promotion) and intangible rewards (e.g. recognition, praise, positive feedback) can facilitate employee voice through the respective effects on employee psychological safety and organizational identification. Using three experiments across three different organizational and cultural contexts, we find consistent results supporting our hypotheses. Our three studies included working adults from the following regions: China (278 participants), United Kingdom (282 participants) and United States (272 participants). We conclude that employees make attributions about organizational reward practices whereby rewards signal to employees it is safe to voice and employees are valued. Our research demonstrates that both tangible and intangible rewards have indirect effects on employee voice by enhancing psychological safety, activating the 'can do' motivation process to voice, and by increasing their organizational identification that triggers the 'reason to' motivation process. We provide practical recommendations for organizations concerning how to use reward practices to best optimise psychological safety and organizational identification to encourage voice and suggest future research directions.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Multinational enterprises (MNEs) have increasingly expanded worldwide, so they need to recruit talent abroad. Nevertheless, the extant recruitment literature lacks an international perspective, as most research has been conducted in a single country context and in developed countries, creating a gap regarding how MNEs can develop optimal international recruiting strategies, considering not only developed but also emerging countries. Based on a cross-national conjoint analysis in an emerging country (Vietnam) and a developed country (the US), we calibrate the relative importance of organizational/job attributes, especially those with symbolic value such as MNEs' country-of-origin (emerging vs. developed) and the three dimensions of CSR (economic, social and environmental responsibilities), together with other instrumental factors (e.g. pay, career opportunities), to young applicants in the two countries. Our results reveal some differences. Applicants from an emerging market attach more value to the economic dimension of CSR;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2275128;Mind your language: an empirical investigation into the role of language in Indian expatriate professionals' adjustment abroad. Expatriates are an integral part of international human resources, enabling multinational corporations (MNCs) to implement and execute strategy. Yet, the issues related to the expatriates' adjustment to their new environments can negatively affect the ability of MNCs to do business. As the major currency of communication, language is among the most complex issues related to adjustment in a new host country. In this study, we contribute by utilizing social learning and linguistic relativity as two key theoretical lenses to identify and examine the dimensions of expatriate adjustment. To do so, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 Indian expatriates in several countries around the world (English and non-English speaking). Our findings revealed five dimensions including (i) nuances of language (ii) role of language (iii) mechanisms to overcome language issues (iv) support and (v) expatriates' adjustment. We analysed the data using the Gioia methodology. We discuss our findings' theoretical and practical implications and offer suggestions for future research.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2250715;Experienced incivility undermines the positive effects of job autonomy on mental and physical health. Integrating insights from conservation of resources theory related to both the positive effects of resources and the detrimental effects of resource loss, this paper examines the effect of job autonomy (an organizational-level resource) on subjective physical pain as mediated by mental health, with experienced workplace incivility (a social stressor) included as a boundary condition. Drawing from the results of a state-wide survey of local government professionals (N = 289), we test a moderated mediation model that estimates the relationships amongst job autonomy, mental health, and physical pain, at differing levels of experienced incivility. Mental health is found to fully mediate the negative relationship between job autonomy and physical pain. When the moderating effect of workplace incivility is incorporated into the model, higher levels of uncivil behavior weaken the otherwise positive and significant effect of job autonomy on mental health. However, the relationship between mental health and physical pain does not depend on levels of workplace incivility. This research has important implications for the management of physical and mental health at work. In particular, the results point to a need to develop human resource policies and practices that both promote job autonomy and tackle experiences of workplace incivility, particularly in local governments.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This inductive research reveals an invisible form of mundane extremity caused by the organisational system and inefficient HRM practices. Based on 30 interviews with social workers across Australia, we employed an interpretivist approach to coding and analysing the data thematically. We identified four paradoxical tensions existing in the domains of occupation, organisation, interpersonal, and work roles that hinder social workers' capabilities to help clients. These tensions generate perceptions of a lack of support, a lack of resources, and role expectation violation, as well as negative feelings of supportlessness, helplessness, powerlessness, and hopelessness, subsequently resulting in physical, psychological, and emotional exhaustion for social workers. Since the inefficiency-driven demands occur in the work processes and not the work itself, they are often not accounted for in the official workload and contribute to mundane work extremity in an invisible manner. Our research enriches the understanding of work extremity, introduces a work extremity lens to understand social work, and connects work extremity research to HRM practices.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this article, we explore the employment relationships of self-initiated expatriates (SIE). Drawing on the concept of psychological contract, we, first, derive a typology of SIEs' employment relationships, differentiated by their perceptions concerning both the employee's and the employer's mutual obligations and fulfillments. Second, we explore what characteristics SIEs with different types of employment relationships possess. Finally, we investigate what implications the identified employment relationships have for the involved SIEs. Based on our analysis, we identify four distinct SIE profiles: professional cosmopolitans, early stage careerists, lost-in-transition escapees, and dependent travelers. The analysis adds to the hitherto scarce literature on the nature and the implications of employment relationships among SIEs and, in this way, increases both our understanding of SIEs as a valuable talent pool and the ways to manage it.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2055970;Patent productivity: Strategic human resources and the attention-based view. Scholars have argued that choices about a firm's human resources are critical to innovation and, in turn, firm success. However, studies of the role human resources (HR) in innovation have tended to focus on the individual level. Yet, broader strategic choices about HR can also impact innovation, and specifically the patent productivity of the firm. Here we draw on the attention-based view to guide the examination of three key concerns for strategic HR management by the top management team (TMT), and the relationship of these variables with patent productivity. We specifically examine TMT rhetoric, presence of an HR executive on the TMT, and HR slack. Our examination shows that the innovation rhetoric of the TMT can be beneficial to patent productivity, while HR slack detracts from patent productivity. Looking deeper we find limited support for the notion that time lags positively moderate the influence of innovation rhetoric and the HR executive effect on patent productivity.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1986109;Technologically mediated human resource management in the gig economy. Gig work accessed through the medium of digital platforms has become an increasingly researched and debated topic owing to several features which distinguish it from other variants of temporary work. It represents a form of working that typically falls outside the standard boundaries of the organisation and employment relationships and where technology has a most pervasive role. This paper, alongside five special issue contributions, explores the enactment of technologically mediated HRM in the gig economy. We make the case for enhanced research efforts on HRM without employment contexts. More specifically, there is a need for greater appreciation of the diversity within the digital platform classification, and what this may mean for the role and value of HRM. While gig workers tend to fall outside the HRM field's remit, we expose how this is problematic given the presence of several activities and practices that one traditionally associates with the HR function.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2019.1569546;Towards a talent retention model: mapping the building blocks of the psychological contract to the three stages of the acquisition process. This paper addresses a gap in the research on talent retention within the context of cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&A). To answer our key research question: How can psychological contracts be shaped to retain talent in an M&A context? We break down the complexity of M&A by taking a process approach. Using a multiple case study methodology involving empirical data from five acquired subsidiaries, we study talent at an individual level in contrast to most studies which focus only on the organisational level. This paper extends our knowledge on the role of the building blocks of the psychological contract in talent retention post-acquisition. Our study highlights the need to reframe HR due diligence within the building blocks of the psychological contract and highlights lessons for practice in this understudied area.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Internal branding strategies, as inselling an organization's brand to employees so that they will sell it to external stakeholders, is a common way for practitioners to get employees to actively support organizational branding efforts. Scholars investigating how organizations best can facilitate such an employee brand support have largely ignored the role of HRM and leader-member exchange (LMX). To test for this data from a survey among Norwegian hospital employees were analyzed. As hypothesized, we found positive relationships between high-commitment HRM and LMX and three manifestations of employee brand support, namely reputation strategy embeddedness, brand-congruent behaviour, and brand development participation. Organizational commitment mediated all the relationships. Examining HRM and LMX simultaneously, we found that LMX moderated the relationship between high-commitment HRM and reputation strategy embeddedness. Theoretical and practical implications and directions for future research are discussed.

We focus on interns as a distinct segment of the job market, with data collected in the Midwest region of the U.S. Study 1, using a lab experiment (n = 579), indicates that recruitment websites with diversity messages have a significant impact on job applicants' perceptions of organizational obligations for offering a diverse and inclusive work environment, in comparison to neutral and exclusive recruitment websites. Moreover, Study 2 (n = 196), based on a field study using two-wave surveys, shows that APC fulfillment mediates the relationship between diversity-related organizational obligations and intention to pursue fulltime employment with the organization. These results suggest that when recruiting interns, employers should be intentional regarding promises made during recruitment to promote accurate APC formation. This is particularly important regarding diversity messaging, because interns hold promises made about diversity more strictly than promises of exclusivity and competitiveness.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2018.1539862;Diversity in totality: A study of diversity disclosures by New Zealand stock exchange listed companies. This study explores diversity reporting by New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX) listed companies, arguing that diversity goes beyond gender and includes differences in age, ethnicity, sexuality, religious beliefs and physical disability. We argue that gender diversity and deep diversity elements (race, age, sexual orientation, disabilities, ethnicity) have a synergistic relationship and that gender diversity objectives cannot be achieved without attaining diversity objectives in these other elements and vice versa. Designing a 30-item diversity disclosures index, this study undertakes a content analysis of the diversity-related disclosures made by 152 NZX listed companies. Analysing diversity-related disclosures in annual and sustainability reports, we find that the NZX listed companies predominantly relate diversity only to board gender diversity. Deep diversity elements at all organisational levels, however, do not receive much attention, with a few exceptions. Our results highlight that female representation on organisational boards has a positive impact on overall organisational gender and other diversity aspects and vice versa. The results of an emphasis on the totality of diversity have important implications for boards of directors, corporate managers and regulators interested in improving the corporate governance and diversity practices in New Zealand organisations.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Although academic production in intelligent automation (e.g. artificial intelligence, robotics) has grown rapidly, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of the utilization of these technologies in human resource management (HRM) at an organizational (firms) and individual (employees) level. This study therefore aims to systematize the academic inputs on intelligent automation so far and to clarify what are its main contributions to and challenges for HRM. In a systematic search of 13,136 potentially relevant studies published in the top HRM, international business (IB), general management (GM) and information management (IM) journals, we found 45 articles studying artificial intelligence, robotics and other advanced technologies within HRM settings. Results show that intelligent automation technologies constitute a new approach to managing employees and enhancing firm performance, thus offering several opportunities for HRM but also considerable challenges at a technological and ethical level. The impact of these technologies has been identified to concentrate on HRM strategies, namely, job replacement, human-robot/AI collaboration, decision-making and learning opportunities, and HRM activities, namely, recruiting, training and job performance. This study discusses these shifts in detail, along with the main contributions to theory and practice and directions for future research.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2428328;Gendered implications of organizational gender diversity for voluntary turnover: human resource practices as strategic levers. Organizational gender diversity may not be as well received among male employees as among female employees, particularly in countries characterized by gender inequality. Through the lens of intergroup threat theory (intergroup threat is experienced when members of one group perceive that another group is in a position to cause them actual or symbolic harm), we conceptualize organizational gender diversity as a threat to male employees, which evokes male employees' voluntary turnover, but as a support (threat mitigation) to female employees, which reduces female employees' voluntary turnover. We also investigate whether certain types of human resource (HR) practices can moderate the gendered implication of organizational gender diversity for voluntary turnover. By analyzing data from South Korea, we found that while collective incentives negatively moderated the positive relationship between organizational gender diversity and male employees' voluntary turnover, childcare benefits strengthened the negative relationship between organizational gender diversity and female employees' voluntary turnover.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2382479;Influence of human resource system strength on collective affective commitment: a contingent approach. This research focuses on the HR strategy implementation process, and in particular on the concept of HR system strength. In this paper we analyze the impact of HR system strength on collective affective commitment and examine this relationship from a contingent perspective, taking into account the moderating effect of leader-member exchange (LMX) and organizational size. The statistical analysis of data obtained from a sample of 142 Spanish companies and 504 key employees indicates that, when the effect of HR practices on collective affective commitment is controlled for, the strength of the HR system also has a positive and significant effect on this affective commitment. Moreover, we conclude that this relationship is not the same for all companies, but depends on the level of LMX in the organization. That is, depending on the overall relationship between leaders and subordinates in the organization, the effect of HR system strength on workforce affective commitment will vary. In particular, when the relationships between leaders and followers are good, the effect of HR system strength on affective commitment is lower.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2351009;Perceived likelihood of standard employment by client organizations and the career mobility of outsourced employees: a self-driving human capital increment model. Externalized employment, aimed at reducing labor costs, is becoming increasingly prevalent. However, the effective implementation of management practices to improve the career mobility of outsourced employees remains unknown. Drawing from social cognitive theory, this study constructs a self-driven career mobility model for outsourced employees. What's more, this study proposes the concept of differentiation in perceived organizational supports (DPOS), that is 'the relative degree of outsourced employee's perception of support from client organizational exceeds that from supplier organization in triangular employment relationships', and regards it as a key boundary condition for outsourced employees to interpret the cognition of employment opportunities. Data were collected from a three-wave survey of 271 outsourced employees from 52 interorganizational teams. Results showed that the perceived likelihood of standard employment (PLSE) by client organizations positively predicts outsourced employees' turnover intention from supplier organization. Job-related human capital development (JRHCD) and occupational self-efficacy play a chain mediating role between PLSE and turnover intention. DPOS moderates the relationship between PLSE and JRHCD, and also moderates the mediating and chain mediating effect of JRHCD and occupational self-efficacy. We discuss the implications of findings for outsourcing management research and practice.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2297827;Reviewing and revising Black et al's adjustment model(s). Previous reviews of Black et al's expatriation and repatriation adjustment models have evaluated the influence and reliability of the models. In this paper, we examine the changing and varied nature of engagement with the models in journal articles on international adjustment to investigate the implications of contemporary changes among expatriates and their behaviours and experiences. 699 peer-reviewed academic articles published between 1991 and 2021 were systematically reviewed. Our analysis reveals that while more than 80% of the articles referenced their model(s), only a third explicitly applied the model(s). Drawing on our findings, we advance a revised version of Black et al's conceptual framework, which integrates their models into a combined stage-adjustment model applicable to both assigned expatriates (AEs) and non-assigned expatriates (NAEs).;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Research on body art as a component of aesthetic labour has predominantly focused on individuals with tattoos in the global north, but little is known about tribal marks as a key element of aesthetic labour that leads to discriminatory or prejudicial attitudes in the workplace. Tribal marks are facial inscriptions that symbolize clan, family, and ethnic affiliation, and serve to distinguish one sociocultural group from another. In this article, we examine the lived experiences of people with tribal marks in Nigeria by developing a theoretical framework based on literatures on aesthetic labour, social stigmatisation, and discrimination. Drawing on the accounts of 42 individuals with tribal marks, we demonstrate how aestheticized work environments, biased assumptions, and negative perceptions about individuals with tribal marks can lead to discriminatory or prejudicial behaviours at work. We further discuss the psychosocial consequences and explain why tribal marks are now perceived to be outdated and damaging to those individuals who have them. We offer a novel perspective on the existing knowledge about aesthetic labour and broaden our understanding of another form of 'lookism' in a non-Western context.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2241821;Can HR managers as ethical leaders cure the menace of precarious work? Important roles of sustainable HRM and HR manager political skill. While extensive research has explored the relationship between HRM and various organizational and employee outcomes, there remains a significant gap in the literature regarding the role of HRM in discouraging extreme work. To address this gap, building mainly on stakeholder theory, we specifically propose that HR managers' ethical leadership negatively influences precarious work, which serves as a catalyst for extreme work cultures by exacerbating workloads, prolonging working hours, and intensifying physical and mental stress. Importantly, we propose that sustainable HRM mediates the association between HR managers' ethical leadership and precarious work. Finally, the present study hypothesizes that HR managers' political skill acts as a boundary condition for the effects of HR managers' ethical leadership on sustainable HRM and precarious work. Data collected from two sources (260 employees and the same number of HR managers) employing a time-lagged design supported our hypotheses. Other than theoretical contributions to different important knowledge areas, such as ethical leadership, HRM, and precarious work, we offer a number of practical implications that could help organizations counter extreme work and its negative repercussions mainly for employees.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2237873;A fifth wheel? Local language skills and work-related outcomes among foreign employees. Drawing on person-job fit theory, we theorize and empirically analyze the effects of host country language skills on two work-related outcomes: workplace social support and perceived overqualification. We further examine how these outcomes are related with job satisfaction. Empirically, we analyze these relationships using data from three sub-studies of foreign academics in the Nordic region. The first is a survey filled in by 496 foreign academics working at 18 universities in Finland, Sweden, and Norway. The second is an interview study of 41 foreign academics employed by a large international university in Finland. The third consists of nine interviews across Finland, Sweden, and Norway where we followed up on the analysis of the data from the first two sub-studies. Whilst we use the quantitative dataset to test our hypotheses, our qualitative data allows us to dig deeper into how making investments in local language skills does not necessary lead to positive work-related outcomes as perceived by foreign academics, and what HR implications these perceptions have for international organizations, such as universities. Overall, our findings provide important insights into the complex and contextual nature of host country language skills' role and effects in international organizations.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2162345;Emotional labor, occupational identity and work engagement in Portuguese police officers. Based on emotional labor theory, we aim to study the relationships between the dimensions of emotional labor (requirements and strategies), work engagement, and occupational identity in Portuguese police officers. Therefore, we intend to explore the possible effects of emotional labor both on work engagement and occupational identity, as well as ways of preventing and/or mitigating the impact of these relationships. We identified a gap in the studies on this subject in Portugal, particularly in the context of police professionals. Thus, a sample of 924 Portuguese police officers of the Public Security Police (PSP) was asked to answer a set of questionnaires: the Emotional Labour Scale, the Emotion Work Requirements Scale, the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, and the Social Identity Scale. The data obtained was analyzed using correlation and multiple linear regression. Overall, the results revealed relationships between the emotional demands (i.e., suppression of negative emotions and expression of positive emotions) and strategies (i.e., deep and surface acting) of emotional labor and work engagement as well as occupational identity. We discuss these results and propose directions for future research, given the richness of the subject.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2108719;Core job characteristics and change oriented organization citizenship behavior: what can managers do on a day-to-day basis?. The purpose of this study is to examine the dynamic relationship between daily job characteristics proposed by job characteristics theory (job autonomy, task variety, significance, identity, and feedback) and change oriented organizational citizenship behavior (OCB-CH). A daily diary survey study design was used, in which 61 employees working in different organizations in Greece, completed a structured questionnaire for five consecutive working days (N=305 occasions). Results from multilevel regression analysis supported the role of daily job autonomy, daily task significance and daily job feedback as within-person positive correlates of OCB-CH. Our model explained 17.72% of the variance in OCB-CH ratings. The study highlights the importance of core job characteristics, for the execution of daily OCB-CH in organizations. However not all job characteristics are suitable for promoting the execution of daily OCB-CH. Managers can enhance their employees' daily OCB-CH by interventions aiming at increasing daily task variety, and task significance along with the degree of daily job autonomy granted to employees.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2083918;Becoming culturally agile: Effectively varying contextual responses through international experience and cross-cultural competencies. Global professionals need to understand the demands of the cultural context in which they are working and respond effectively within it. Building on existing literature highlighting the importance of cross-cultural competencies and international experience for global work, this study expands knowledge by examining whether employees with cross-cultural competencies and international experience are better able to vary their cross-cultural responses to effectively match the cultural demands of the work environment. Tested with nearly 500 professionals globally, this study found that cultural humility, tolerance of ambiguity, and international experience predict professionals' abilities to accurately judge the best cultural response for a given work-related situation. The findings have implications for international human resource management in two ways. First, organizations should assess for cross-cultural competencies to select for roles requiring an understanding of the cultural context. Second, organizations should provide international experiences as part of a global leadership or global talent development program.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2078992;Voluntary versus involuntary telecommuting and employee innovative behaviour: a daily diary study. During the COVID-19 crisis, telecommuting has gradually attracted the public's attention. Past studies on the subject have produced inconsistent findings, suggesting that telecommuting can lead to simultaneous benefits and drawbacks. To discuss the deeper reasons for this finding, we divided telecommuting into two types-voluntary and involuntary telecommuting. Based on the job demands-resources model, we explored the impact of voluntary-involuntary telecommuting on employee innovative behaviour through co-worker emotional support, and we examined the cross-level moderating effect of organisational identification. Using the daily diary method, we collected 455 valid observations from 65 employees for eight consecutive days. The results show that compared with involuntary telecommuting, voluntary telecommuting leads to more co-worker emotional support, in a mediating role, and employee innovative behaviour. Furthermore, a high level of organisational identification enlarges the difference in co-worker emotional support for employees voluntarily or involuntarily telecommuting. Our results uncover those differences and fill the research gap on telecommuter motivation.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2035161;Artificial intelligence - challenges and opportunities for international HRM: a review and research agenda. Artificial intelligence (AI) and other AI-based applications are being integrated into firms' human resource management (HRM) approaches for managing people in domestic and international organisations. The last decade has seen a growth in AI-based applications proliferating the HRM function, triggering an exciting new stream of research on topics such as the social presence of AI and robotics, effects of AI adoption on individual and business level outcomes, and evaluating AI-enabled HRM practices. Adopting these technologies has resulted in how work is organised in local and international firms, noting opportunities for employees and firms' resource utilisation, decision-making, and problem-solving. However, despite a growing interest in scholarship, research on AI-based technologies for HRM is limited and fragmented. Further research is needed that analyses the role of AI-assisted applications in HRM functions and human-AI interactions in large multinational enterprises diffusing such innovations. In response to these combined issues-the fragmented nature of research and limited extant literature, we present a systematic review on the theme of this special issue and offer a nuanced understating of what is known, yet to be known, and future research directions to frame a future research agenda for international HRM. We develop a conceptual framework that integrates research on AI applications in HRM and offers a cohesive base for future research endeavours. We also develop a set of testable propositions that serve as directions for future research.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Furthermore, integrating research on self-construal, this study sets out to examine the moderating role of a key personal disposition;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.2006746;HRM system situational strength in support of strategy: its effects on employee attitudes and business unit performance. Strong HRM systems, characterized by HRM processes that send clear and consistent messages to employees about what their employer values, expects and rewards, should be associated with a range of valued individual and organizational outcomes. Nonetheless, there are few empirical studies of the anticipated ties, especially at a unit-level of analysis. This study uses situational strength theory to test Bowen and Ostroff ' s proposition that HRM systems contribute to firm performance when they communicate messages around strategic objectives in a manner that ensures a shared interpretation among employees. As one of the few studies to examine the extent to which shared interpretations of the messages communicated by HR practices associate with strategic organization climate and performance, we assess the effects of the HRM system strength construct at both the individual and group levels. As hypothesized, employee perceptions of HRM system strength associated positively with work-related attitudes and behavior. At the unit level, HRM system strength was positively linked to a strategic climate and to business performance (e.g. net income against target). This study draws attention to the importance of capturing the group level attributes of the HRM system strength construct.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2019.1674355;How social capital influences performance in family firms: the moderating role of nepotism. Although a large body of research has explored how organizational social capital (OSC) benefits organizational performance, results are not conclusive. Consequently, scholars have called for more research on the factors that may moderate the effects of OSC on organizational performance. We address this research gap and examine the role of nepotism, which is the preferential treatment of family members in human resource management (HRM)-related decisions, such as development or rewards, in the relationship between OSC and organizational performance. Using a sample of 77 family firms in Switzerland, we found that the relationship between OSC and organizational performance is stronger in firms with higher nepotism. This research contributes to the HRM literature by exploring how the preferential treatment of family members in HRM-related decisions (i.e. greater nepotism) can provide benefits to family firms in terms of the impact of OSC on organizational performance.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1949625;Migrants working for migrants: dependence and discourse in Chinese-owned small commercial businesses in South Africa. The nature of work and employment relations of small Chinese migrant businesses in South Africa remains largely under-researched, despite the significant growth of these businesses since the 2000s. Based on 90 interviews with Chinese business owners and their African workers, we found that, although employment relations were largely transactional and adversarial, they sometimes also incorporated symbiotic accommodations with third-country undocumented immigrant workers and pockets of de facto responsible autonomy. Material imbalances of power were notably alleviated through workers' superior local language skills and cultural familiarity, enabling them to carve out space as intermediaries with customers and other local stakeholders to counter the power of employers. However, this autonomy is relatively small in scope, in large part due to the precarious nature of the employment and the workers' immigration status.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1893784;The relationship between gender and work-to-family conflict among Chinese managers: testing a moderated mediation model. This study of 390 full-time Chinese managers examined the relationship between gender and work-to-family conflict. Guided by identity theory, we found that work centrality and family centrality mediated the relationship between gender and work-to-family conflict. The findings indicate men follow a work centrality pathway that results in increased work-to-family conflict and women follow a family centrality pathway that also results in higher levels of work-to-family conflict. Gender role attitudes moderated the relationship between gender and work centrality, and the indirect relationship between gender and work-to-family conflict through work centrality was stronger for managers with traditional gender role attitudes than those with non-traditional gender role attitudes. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2018.1511618;Human resource management in Australian hospitals: the role of controls in influencing the effectiveness of performance management systems. This study examines the association between two aspects of HRM, the use of controls (beliefs, interactive, boundary, diagnostic) and the effectiveness of performance management systems (PMSs), which are assessed in respect to the achievement of process outcomes and hospital performance. The findings indicate that the achievement of process outcomes (both performance-related and staff-related outcomes) mediates the relationship between controls and hospital performance. Specifically, the achievement of performance-related outcomes mediates the associations between belief systems and the use of diagnostic controls with hospital performance (medical facilities), and the achievement of staff-related outcomes mediates the association between the use of diagnostic controls with the support facilities and effectiveness dimensions of hospital performance. In addition, the use of specific controls exhibits a direct impact on hospital performance with beliefs systems directly positively associated with all five hospital performance dimensions, the use of interactive controls positively associated with three dimensions (medical facilities, patient care, and staff resources), the diagnostic use of controls associated with the patient care dimension, and boundary controls positively associated with all dimensions of hospital performance except staff resources. The findings inform hospital management of their significant role in incorporating these HRM practices to effectively manage the workplace in hospitals.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1886148;Staying close to business: the role of epistemic alignment in rendering HR analytics outputs relevant to decision-makers. HR Analytics (HRA) are said to create value when providing analytical outputs that are relevant to decision-makers' immediate business issues. While extant research on HRA attributes success (or lack thereof) in providing business relevant outputs to the presence or absence of particular skills and resources, we know little about how practitioners actually mobilize these skills and resources in daily practice. Drawing on observational and interview data from a case study of an HRA team, we identify boundary spanning, customizing dashboards, and speaking a language of numbers as three epistemic practices in which team members combine and mobilize a particular set of skills and resources that allows them to accomplish epistemic alignment, i.e. aligning to decision-makers' perception of business reality when creating analytical outputs. Epistemic alignment enables the team members to produce complex analytical outputs while at the same time staying close to the decision-makers' immediate business problems. At the same time, team members are capable of accounting for conditions in the broader organizational context, such as compliance issues, dependencies, political tensions, and a prevailing data-driven decision culture. Our findings contribute to knowledge on how organizations can build effective HRA and how advanced forms of digitalization transform the work of HRM in contemporary organizations.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2428356;The impact of legal uncertainties on innovating HR practices in developing countries: a case study of remote work during the healthcare crisis in Kazakhstan's technical gas industry. This study explores the influence of legal uncertainties on the process of innovating human resources (HR) practices in developing countries. Through a case study focused on introducing remote work within Kazakhstan's Technical Gas Industry during a healthcare crisis, we examine the multifaceted challenges and opportunities that emerge when navigating a complex legal landscape. Our findings reveal that legal uncertainties, stemming from inadequacies in legislation and the tightness of norms, significantly impede the ability to adapt and modernize HR practices during crises. Furthermore, the criticality of the company's position within the industry, combined with a low degree of legal enforcement, underscores the concept of 'responsibilization' among HR professionals. This phenomenon compels HR practitioners to assume greater responsibility and make strategic decisions that occasionally push the boundaries of existing laws and regulations. In this context, we propose a novel conceptualization of responsibilization, distinct from empowerment, as it involves embracing negative legal consequences associated with proactive decision-making during crises. This study contributes significantly to our understanding of how legal uncertainties influence the process of HR innovation in developing countries, highlighting the intricate interplay between regulatory frameworks, crisis management, and organizational transformation.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1080/09585192.2023.2287548;Job embeddedness among internationally relocated workers between spillover effects, crossover effects, and transnationalism: a review and agenda for future research. The retention of internationally relocated workers (IRWs) and their job embeddedness hold significant importance for employers facing labor and skill shortages. While the concept of job embeddedness has been empirically validated using national samples, there exists a paucity of examination regarding its applicability and evolution within the context of IRWs. In our systematic review of 45 empirical studies, we have discerned three distinctive characteristics of job embeddedness applicable to IRWs. These include heightened spillover and crossover effects compared to their domestic counterparts, as well as transnationalism. The spillover and crossover effects describe how IRWs establish and fortify their embeddedness within the host country, while transnationalism expands the constellation of job embeddedness by incorporating a multi-country component. We summarized relevant literature and provided propositions for each characteristic, as well as outlined its implications for theory and practice.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2278525;Antecedents and consequences of perpetrator-centric knowledge hiding within organizations: a cross-cultural meta-analytic review and implications for human resource management. As knowledge hiding has become an increasingly widespread phenomenon within organizations, there has been a dramatic increase in research on this topic over the past two decades. However, previous studies have provided inconsistent conclusions on why knowledge hiding occurs and how it affects the perpetrator's subsequent work and well-being outcomes. As no reviews to date have focused on the knowledge hiding from the perpetrator's perspective, this meta-analysis systematically synthesizes frequently studied antecedents and consequences of perpetrator-centric knowledge hiding. It also examines the moderating effects of cultural dimensions and causal directions on the consequences. Based on evidence from N = 193 sources with a total sample size of N = 68,113, this meta-analysis found significantly strong relationships between neuroticism, moral disengagement (hider's factors), psychological contract breach, toxic leadership, leader-signaled knowledge hiding, perceived organizational politics (contextual factors) and knowledge hiding. The findings revealed that knowledge hiding had a medium-sized positive relationship with perpetrator psychological strain. It also uncovered the cross-cultural differences among the perpetrator-centric consequences. These findings helped answer the question of whether some common predictors or outcomes of knowledge hiding should be identified as outcomes or indicators. Finally, it provided suggestions for future research and human resource management (HRM) practices.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2273331;Role (in-)congruity and the Catch 22 for female executives: how stereotyping contributes to the gender pay gap at top executive level. We examine to what extent the gender pay gap at top executive level is linked to gender stereotypes, i.e. to societal beliefs about the attributes women and men possess and the roles they ought to perform. We theorize that, even at the highest hierarchical level of an organization, executive functions are gender stereotyped: some (such as IT) are considered typically 'masculine', while others (such as human resources) are considered typically 'feminine'. We argue gender stereotyping at the executive level to be related to pay such that masculine functions are paid more than feminine ones. Referring to role congruity theory, we further argue that women are paid better when they hold less masculine and therefore more role congruous functions. We find supportive evidence for both predictions when studying large European companies across the years 2014 to 2018. Pay data for 353 executives were linked to results of a survey in which participants were asked to rate the masculinity of the areas of responsibility of different executive functions. We find an empirical pattern that reflects a Catch 22 situation in which women executives appear unable to increase their pay by switching to more masculine functions that are, on average, better paid.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2258360;In search of organizational strategic competitiveness? A systematic review of human resource outsourcing literature (1999-2022). Human resource outsourcing (HRO) has been an important development in the HRM function since the 1990s as organizations seek cost reduction and competitive advantages. Does HRO enhance organizational competitiveness and strategic capability? Based on a systematic review of 97 journal articles published between 1999 and 2022, we identify several key patterns of existing research on HRO, such as a heavy reliance on quantitative methods, the dominance of traditional economic theories, and a focus mainly on the perspective of client organizations. However, whether HRO services can accomplish organizational strategic capability remains equivocal. To unpack the relationship between HRO and organizational performance, we establish an HRO process model which includes several blocks: HRO decision, HRO implementation, HRO perception, HRO evaluation, and HRO maintenance. Among these blocks, there is a dynamic interplay between multiple stakeholders across fields. We call for future HRO research and practice to pay attention to employee perception to enhance HRO's effect and value as part of strategic human resource management, thus extending HR system strength theory. We also call for future research to clarify the contextual role of emerging technology in promoting HRO, given the increasing use of digital technology and HR data analytics.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the face of an increasingly pressing refugee crisis, understanding how organizations' human resource management (HRM) support practices are perceived by refugee workers is critical not only for refugee well-being but also organizational effectiveness. Grounded on self-determination theory (SDT), the current study contributes to this understanding by 1) testing refugee workers' perceptions of HRM support practices as helpful or needs-satisfying-in terms of fulfilling autonomy, competence, and relatedness needs, and 2) exploring the mechanisms-why refugees find the practices needs satisfying. We surveyed both refugee (n = 99) and non-refugee workers (n = 345) in the U.S. The findings highlighted that, compared to non-refugees, refugee workers tend to view autonomy practices as especially helpful. Moreover, some of the need differences were mediated by refugees' higher work centrality. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of how future HRM can support refugee well-being.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2211712;Driven to succeed, or to leave? The variable impact of self-leadership in rideshare gig work. The nature of gig work - temporary, task-based work that is facilitated by applications and platforms - lacks the structural, interpersonal, and organizational dynamics of leadership. Instead, algorithms and software are the primary source of organizational and informational resources for a gig worker in a process known as 'algorithmic management'. Job performance and career success depends primarily on the individual gig worker's ability to establish objectives, identify strategies, and develop skills for job performance on their own. As such, success in gig work is likely to be connected to self-leadership ability. Drawing on the psychological perspectives of control theory and conservation of resources theory, we find that the agency provided by self-leadership is generally beneficial to rideshare drivers (N = 924) in that it increases both well-being and the intention to seek non-gig work. However, enacting this agency as a leaderless worker is an intensive process, and can either be a resource gain or drain. We find that workers experience better or worse outcomes, respectively, under circumstances of high job satisfaction or high financial stress. Implications and directions for future HRM research and practice among other gig and traditional worker populations are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2191209;Ethical leadership and follower unethical pro-organizational behavior: examining the dual influence mechanisms of affective and continuance commitments. This paper aims to examine the indirect effects of ethical leadership on unethical pro-organizational behavior (UPB). We primarily examine how two types of organizational commitment (i.e. affective commitment and continuance commitment) mediate the effect of the supervisors' ethical leadership on their followers' UPB. Collecting data from 291 employees in South Korea, at two points in time, we found that ethical leadership has a negative relationship with follower UPB through affective commitment and has a positive relationship with follower UPB through continuance commitment. Furthermore, follower organizational identification moderates the mediation processes, which makes the affective commitment-UPB relationship more negative but the continuance commitment-UPB relationship more positive when the followers more closely identify with their organization. We also discuss the theoretical contributions and practical implications.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Exploring the critical but largely overlooked rule-breaking nature of entrepreneurship, we study how a specific form of rule-breaking-prosocial rule-breaking (PSRB), can impact people's entrepreneurial career intentions. Based on the virtue-based model of entrepreneurial rule-breaking, stewardship theory, and the expectancy framework, we expect that employees' affective organizational commitment will lead to employees' PSRB, which, under some conditions, is related to their tendency to quit and start new businesses. Our moderated mediation analyses on time-lagged data from two samples in China support an indirect relationship between affective organizational commitment and entrepreneurial intentions mediated by PSRB and moderated by age and entrepreneurial self-efficacy simultaneously. We discuss theoretical and practical implications.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2148552;A bibliometric analysis of the psychologization of human resource management. Despite years of discussion, whether and to what extent human resource management (HRM) has been psychologized remains controversial. We consider HRM psychologization as indicated by a disciplinary (i.e., the relative contribution of psychology and other fields to HRM research) and an inter-disciplinary component (i.e., knowledge integration of psychology and other fields in HRM research). Accordingly, we apply two bibliometric methods (i.e., citation and co-citation analysis) to a sample of 6,709 articles published in six HRM journals from 2000 to 2021. Overall, psychology became more influential as a citation source in HRM research but integrated more closely with other intellectual sources in the period examined. In addition, HRM psychologization was contingent on HRM journals, the first authors' countries, and HRM subdomains. This study presents an enriched pattern of psychologization as well as substantial quantitative evidence that confirms, counters, or extends prior findings.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Research on diversity programs provides inconclusive knowledge regarding their effect on firm performance. In this study, we build on the Ability-Motivation-Opportunity framework to examine the relationship between firm diversity-enhancement program bundle and firm performance. Based on a dataset covering 2,794 U.S. publicly listed firms over 15 years, we find support for our hypothesis that firm diversity-enhancement program bundle results in a greater pay-off when it is coupled with a stronger employee ownership program at the firm level or a greater technological opportunity at the industry level. Furthermore, the pay-off is greatest when a firm's diversity-enhancement program bundle, its employee ownership program, and its environmental technological opportunity are all high. Overall, our study provides nuanced theoretical and empirical accounts regarding a firm's integrated diversity-enhancement efforts. It also provides novel managerial implications regarding when firms can reap the most benefit from their integrated diversity-enhancement efforts.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The extent to which individuals feel that they are known and understood by others (i.e., self-verification perceptions) is related to a number of important employee outcomes. However, we know little about what contextual and personal factors are associated with self-verification perceptions, and if such perceptions are related to employees' discrete emotions. Time-lagged data collected from 163 employees revealed that perceived organizational and supervisor support were positively associated with self-verification perceptions, which were in turn related to more positive and less negative emotions. We also found that having high proactive personality significantly enhanced the relationship between perceived organizational support and self-verification perceptions but reduced the relationship between perceived supervisor support and self-verification perceptions. The results provide evidence of the importance of supportive work environments and proactive individual traits to help employees feel known and understood.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper addresses this research gap and investigates major challenges in TM faced by organizations in professional sports business and makes an increasingly significant contribution towards the global economy. The question of what constitutes 'talent' in sports and how it can be strategically managed is a matter of concern which expands the knowledge and understanding of Talent Management practices in a unique and rapidly developing sector. The current study explores the scope and boundaries of TM practices for professional sports entities in the context of emerging economies. The study uses case study approach to examine TM for the Nepal based Everest Premier League (EPL) The study draws on the Social Exchange Theory (SET) and Human Capital Theory (HCT) to understand talent management practices and demonstrates how differing natures of socio-economic exchange can be observed across actors and stages of TM in the business of sports.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Employees contribute to organizational effectiveness in a variety of ways that go beyond job specific task performance. Organizational citizenship behavior and contextual performance describe behaviors that are discretionary, but still important. Contextual performance supports the organization's social and interpersonal infrastructure. Research suggests employees' overall effectiveness ratings are influenced by both task performance and contextual performance. If it is truly discretionary, contextual performance should contribute more to overall effectiveness when workers have more autonomy. This study explores the relationship between autonomy, task performance and interpersonal facilitation, a dimension of contextual performance. Results for N = 135 air force technicians suggest perceived autonomy moderates the relationship between interpersonal facilitation and overall effectiveness. Autonomy did not moderate the relationship between task performance and overall effectiveness.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Conflict is inevitable and an essential part of organizational life, as the goals of employers and employees are often incompatible. In this study, by employing both qualitative and quantitative methods, we inductively identified the categories of labor relations conflicts (interest-based, rights-based, and affect-based conflicts) and developed a three-dimensional scale that reflects employees' perceptions of labor relations conflicts in the Chinese context. By using matched data from 1223 employees and 136 human resource (HR) managers and employing hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analysis, we tested the hypotheses and examined the effectiveness of partnership practices on reducing labor relations conflicts, the negative effects of labor relations conflicts on employees' attitudes and behaviors, and the mediating role of labor relations conflicts on the relationship between partnership practices and employees' attitudes and behaviors. The theoretical contributions and practical implications of the findings are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2018.1522655;Unlocking the full potential of absorptive capacity: the systematic effects of high commitment work systems. Integrating perspectives of absorptive capacity and strategic human resource management, we examine how high commitment work systems (HCWS) affect a firm's absorptive capacity and subsequent new product and service performance. We posit that HCWS act as an antecedent of a firm's absorptive capacity-the organizational ability to acquire, assimilate, transform and exploit knowledge. We also posit that HCWS strengthen the positive relationship between absorptive capacity and new product and service performance. Results from a sample of 198 firms support the major contention. This study shows that a firm's realized absorptive capacity partially mediates the relationship between potential absorptive capacity and new product and service performance. In the process of a firm's deploying absorptive capacity to enhancing new product and service performance, HCWS exhibit distinctive strategic value. They not only play an organizational capability-building role that fosters a firm's absorptive capacity, but may also play an efficiency-enhancing role that facilitates the process of transforming absorptive capacity into superior new product and service performance. This study sheds light on how human resource practices affect the development and effectiveness of organizational capabilities.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2373246;How do employees shape HR implementation? Intra-team acceptance of espoused HR practices, frontline managers' implementation behavior, and team performance. This study investigates the critical role of employees in shaping frontline managers' (FLMs) HR implementation. It goes beyond previous research, which recurrently attributes FLMs' implementation behavior to the facilitating conditions and FLMs' personal capabilities, overlooking or downplaying the potential impact of employees during the implementation process. In doing so, we characterize the construct of intra-team acceptance of espoused HR practices as a key force influencing FLMs' HR enactment. Hence, we hypothesize how intra-team acceptance of espoused HR practices is linked to FLMs' implementation behavior through FLMs' performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence. In this narrative, we position team-level HPWS as a direct outcome of FLMs' implementation behavior. Therefore, we establish that team-level HPWS mediates the relationship between FLMs' implementation behavior and team performance, underscoring the importance of employees in the HRM variability debate. Conducting a time-lagged study and analyzing data collected from 23 South Korean firms, we found support for our theoretical claims. Our findings recognize employees as significant contributors to the implementation process and challenge the conventional wisdom in which employees are viewed as passive recipients of HR practices. We discuss theoretical and managerial implications and offer directions for future endeavors.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2335515;Machine learning with real-world HR data: mitigating the trade-off between predictive performance and transparency. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms offer a powerful tool for capturing multifaceted relationships through inductive research to gain insights and support decision-making in practice. This study contributes to understanding the dilemma whereby the more complex ML becomes, the more its value proposition can be compromised by its opacity. Using a longitudinal dataset on voluntary employee turnover from a German federal agency, we provide evidence for the underlying trade-off between predictive performance and transparency for ML, which has not been found in similar Human Resource Management (HRM) studies using artificially simulated datasets. We then propose measures to mitigate this trade-off by demonstrating the use of post-hoc explanatory methods to extract local (employee-specific) and global (organisation-wide) predictor effects. After that, we discuss their limitations, providing a nuanced perspective on the circumstances under which the use of post-hoc explanatory methods is justified. Namely, when a 'transparency-by-design' approach with traditional linear regression is not sufficient to solve HRM prediction tasks, the translation of complex ML models into human-understandable visualisations is required. As theoretical implications, this paper suggests that we can only fully understand the multi-layered HR phenomena explained to us by real-world data if we incorporate ML-based inductive methods together with traditional deductive methods.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2254207;The politics of selective and differential transfer of HRM practices in employee-owned MNCs: evidence from an emblematic European worker co-op. This paper examines the cross-national transfer of HRM practices at Up Group, an emblematic French multinational worker co-op. Our findings reveal that stakeholder pressure to disseminate the co-op's core HRM practices to its foreign subsidiaries triggered two key strategic responses from the HQ member-owners: transfer circumvention and ceremonial transfer. Therefore, our study provides new insights into the political and contested nature of practice transfer by elucidating how MNCs actively engage in the selective and differential transfer of some of their core HRM practices to protect the HQ actors' interests and preserve their position of power vis-a-vis the subsidiaries. In addition, our fine-grained analysis of the ceremonially transferred practices contributes to the literature on practice variation during diffusion processes in MNCs. Finally, by examining the challenges of the cross-national management of people in multinational worker co-ops, an increasingly important global player, this study addresses critical management scholars' calls to broaden the horizons of IHRM research beyond the hegemonic analysis of for-profit shareholder-owned MNCs.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2237871;Extreme work in extraordinary times: the impact of COVID-stress on the resilience and burnout of frontline paramedic workers - the importance of perceived organisational support. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed significant and extreme pressure on frontline healthcare workers, including paramedics. Yet, within the human resource management (HRM) literature, little is known about how working in extreme conditions affects individual behaviours and wellbeing, or how HRM may provide coping strategies. Drawing on conservation of resources theory (COR), our study provides insights into how COVID-stress influences paramedic burnout by considering the mediating role of resilience and the moderating role of perceived organisational support (POS). Findings from a survey of 648 paramedic workers employed in Victoria, Australia, during the height of the 2020 pandemic lockdowns confirm our hypotheses. COVID-stress was negatively related to resilience. We find that resilience mediated the positive relationship between COVID-stress and burnout. Moreover, POS acted as a protective buffer, thus reducing the negative effects of COVID-stress. We make an important contribution to the literature on extreme work, as represented by COVID-stress, by demonstrating that perceived organisational support is a key resource that supports and ensures the sustainability of paramedics engaging in extreme work.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2119596;The role of recontextualization and socialization practices in transferring corporate values from a small Norwegian IT company to an Indian subsidiary. Companies that nurture a shared corporate culture based on specific corporate values can improve their performance. However, when companies expand globally, communicating and transferring these values can be challenging, particularly when there are significant linguistic and cultural differences. This qualitative study examined the case of a small Norwegian IT company that has put its two corporate values at the core of its activity, and how these values were transferred to a subsidiary in India. Drawing on the concept of recontextualization and socialization theory, the study investigates the following: (1) how the corporate values were transferred, recontextualized and renegotiated in the Indian subsidiary;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.2023895;Furthering transgender inclusion in the workplace: advancing a new model of allyship intentions and perceptions. There remains a significant knowledge gap in HRM regarding the inclusion of transgender (henceforth 'trans') workers. We examine and apply the emerging concept of allyship (a specific form of active support and advocacy for minority groups) to trans workers, and in doing so we advance a new model of allyship intentions and perceptions. We test our model across two studies. The first extends theorising on perceived diversity and inclusion climate (PDIC) and social dominance orientation (SDO) to explain how non-trans workers can exhibit trans allyship intentions. When non-trans workers were presented with a scenario of a co-worker disclosing their trans identity, we find that SDO is negatively related with allyship intentions, yet PDIC moderates this relationship, such that the negative impact of SDO is buffered by the positive influence of PDIC. The second study builds upon theorising on psychological safety and authenticity to explain how perceived allyship facilitates the wellbeing of trans workers. We find, in a survey of trans workers, that perceived allyship is positively associated with psychological safety and authenticity at work;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1996431;Is it your engagement or mine? Linking supervisors' work engagement and employee performance. Despite the growing interest in work engagement crossover among employees, we still need more research about the role of the supervisors' work engagement on employees' states and behaviors. This study examines the relationship between the supervisors' work engagement and the employees' work engagement. We also investigate how supervisors' and employees' work engagement relate to employees' in-role and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Finally, we explore the mediating role of employees' affective commitment linking employees' and supervisors' work engagement to employees' performance. To test the proposed model, we performed multilevel models with a sample of 570 employees nested around 88 supervisors from 7 organizations in Ecuador. Results show that supervisors' work engagement is not related to employees' work engagement. Employees' affective commitment partially mediates the relationship between employees' work engagement and performance, whereas employees' affective commitment fully mediates the relationship between supervisors' work engagement and employee performance. Thus, employees' emotional attachment significantly impacts employee performance (in-role and organizational citizenship behavior) among engaged employees.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1945652;Insider's corruption versus outsider's ethicality? Individual responses to conflicting institutional logics. In this article, we seek to understand whether and to what extent the sense of belonging to a powerful network affects individual decision-making in terms of ethicality with regard to a corrupt situation. We study the behaviour of insiders (individuals who belong to a power network, i.e. a network of individuals connected by interpersonal relationships to a person in a position of power) and outsiders in a corrupt versus non-corrupt environments using the theoretical frameworks of institutional logics and informal networks. Our hypotheses were tested with the help of a vignette-based experiment with 464 participants from countries considered as corrupt (Kazakhstan and Russia) and non-corrupt (UK and USA).;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1900321;Dual-focused transformational leadership and individual creativity: moderating effects of team scout activity and individual perspective-taking. This paper developed and tested a research model in which team- and individual-focused transformational leadership (TFL) influence individual creativity through psychological empowerment and the positive effects of team- and individual-focused TFL are moderated via team scout activity and individual perspective-taking. Using multilevel and multisource matched data collected from 44 team leaders and 151 employees in 21 companies, we found that team- and individual-focused TFL had a significant indirect effect on individual creativity through psychological empowerment. The effect of team-focused TFL was significant only when team scout activity was high, whereas the effect of individual-focused TFL was significant only when individual perspective-taking was high.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1934711;The role of organization-based self-esteem and job resources in promoting employees' job crafting behaviors. Employees' job crafting is important because it can result in better person-job fit and motivate better performance, producing favorable outcomes for both employees and organizations. Based on conservation of resources and job crafting theories, we examined effects of environmental resources (job security, autonomy, and feedback) on employees' crafting behaviors through organization-based self-esteem. Data were collected at two time points with a four-week interval. With 425 full-time U.S. employees, path analysis demonstrated that organization-based self-esteem (a personal resource) explained indirect relationships of environmental resources with job crafting behaviors. Furthermore, role ambiguity had a negative influence on the use of resources. It moderated the positive links between environmental resources and organization-based self-esteem, making them weaker, thereby limiting the indirect theoretical effect that resources could have on job crafting. Overall, findings suggest that environmental and personal resources are important antecedents of employees' proactive job crafting at work.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1897642;The benefits and penalties of formal and informal flexible working-time arrangements: evidence from a cohort study of Australian mothers. While flexible working-time arrangements are highly sought-after entitlements for the reconciliation of work and family responsibilities, they also risk workplace stigma and deterioration in users' (typically mothers') employment status and career prospects. Among potential influences on these outcomes is the formality of provisions. In this analysis we examine job satisfaction, work/family benefits and employment penalties among Australian mothers using flexible working arrangements, comparing the outcomes of those who accessed flexible working-time arrangements formally (through policy provisions available at their workplace) with the outcomes of those who used informally negotiated arrangements. Using data from a nationally representative cohort of working mothers, we show that the use of flexible working-time arrangements was positively associated with specific indicators of job satisfaction, and that this association was stronger among mothers who accessed formal arrangements. However, formality was positively associated not only with perceived benefits (such as more time with family) but also with problems (such as intensified workloads and lost opportunities for training). Overall, our findings suggest that while formality is important, it may also amplify the tension between benefits and penalties associated with flexible working-time arrangements.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1886150;When leader-member exchange leads to knowledge sharing: The roles of generalself-efficacy, team leader modeling, and LMX differentiation. Social exchange theory suggests that team members are willing to share their knowledge with each other due to the reciprocity motive stimulated by high-quality exchange relationships with their leader (LMX). However, the relationship may not be this simple. Applying the social learning and self-efficacy elements of social cognitive theory, we propose that team members with higher general self-efficacy are more likely to share knowledge with their teammates when they also enjoy high-quality LMX with the leader. In addition, we hypothesize that this effect is stronger when team members learn how to effectively share knowledge by observing their leader share knowledge or when the variances in LMX qualities within a team (LMX differentiation) are smaller. We also propose that knowledge sharing has a meaningful impact on performance at the team level and hypothesize that team-level knowledge sharing is positively related to team-level performance. Using a field sample of 342 individuals in 56 teams, we find support for our model. These findings advance our understanding of when and why individuals are willing to reciprocate higher-quality LMX relationships by sharing their knowledge with other teammates, and the positive effect this has on team performance.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2018.1496125;Diversity and inclusion branding: a five-country comparison of corporate websites. In their quest to attract talent and appear as an employer of choice, organizations must articulate the benefits of having a diverse and inclusive workforce. By communicating the attractiveness of the workplace, a company increases its exposure to the environment as an employer of choice. Within the context of employer branding, we highlight two emerging concepts that encompass corporate communication in the form of diversity and inclusion statements: diversity branding and inclusion branding. We examine the websites of 75 major companies in five different countries (France, Germany, Spain, the UK and the US). The article highlights that organizations use diversity and inclusion branding to attract talent, become employers of choice and dimensionalize diversity to signal that specific dimensions of diversity are relevant to the organization. We show that diversity and inclusion branding has become 'mainstream' and how a focus on diversity is particularly useful to attract talent while to appear as an employer of choice a focus on inclusion seems particularly beneficial.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2271835;Constant connectivity and boundary management behaviors: the role of human agency. The surge of remote and hybrid work in the post-pandemic era has reinforced the blurred boundaries between work and nonwork responsibilities. Thus, how people manage the boundaries between work and nonwork domains has become more complicated. This study advances the work of previous studies on constant connectivity by focusing on how employees' perception of constant connectivity might actualize their boundary management behaviors. By adopting affordances for practice perspective, our study focused on contextual factors, including IT/internet policies, informal social norms, and work flexibility, to investigate how these factors could influence employees' perception of constant connectivity. This paper reports a two-phase study. In the first phase, we used sentiment analysis to rank 38 internet use policies of Australian universities, grading their strictness toward ICT/internet use. Next, building on the first phase, we interviewed 28 academics. We identified three perceptions of constant connectivity related to participants' practices, including constant connectivity as a resource for practice, a challenge for practice, and duality for practice. We also found five distinct boundary management behaviors connected to three different perceptions.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Based on recent research on extreme work and social exchange theory, this paper presents a pioneering study focussed on public hospital nurses' engagement in extreme work conditions and its associated ethical aspects. The empirical part comprises of 32 in-depth interviews conducted with nurses in four public hospitals in Egypt. Our findings highlight how a misunderstanding of religion, gender inequality, average education, and staff shortages are the main reasons of nurses' engagement in intensive jobs. Moreover, poor physical and mental health, lack of time for personal commitments, and a sense of coercion emerged as aspects that raise questions regarding the (un)ethicality of nurses engaging in extreme work.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2110845;How capital shapes refugees' access to the labour market: the case of Syrians in Sweden. This paper highlights the ways Syrian refugees in Sweden utilise the different forms of capital available to them in order to find jobs and rebuild their careers. Relying on 25 in-depth interviews with Syrians who sought asylum in Sweden between 2012 and 2015, we discuss their use of social and cultural capital in order to access the Swedish labour market. While all our respondents are aware of the need to acquire capital in Sweden in order to find opportunities for work, their homeland cultural capital informs their decisions, outlooks and the kinds of options they utilise to navigate the institutional requirements in their new environment. As a result, the majority end up replicating their social positions that they had in Syria. Our analysis indicates that institutional programs aimed at labour market integration need to account for the role of social and cultural capital in realizing their goals.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2093121;Gender diversity and firm performance: when diversity at middle management and staff levels matter. The social construction of gender has led to differences in beliefs, knowledge, experiences, or networks between women and men. Some argue that mixed gender teams can show perform better. However, empirical research at the firm level has provided mixed evidence. Moreover, these studies mainly focus on the board of directors or top management teams. Few have examined how middle management and staff levels affect firm performance. These levels form the operational layers that execute the business strategy and run daily operations. Using a unique dataset of 159 large French firms, we find that gender diversity at the two organisational levels positively impacts a firm's economic performance and contributes to its competitiveness. Gender diversity at these levels is a strategic resource that provides a sustainable competitive advantage by creating value and cannot be easily imitated by competitors quickly. We also find a nonlinear relationship due to a threshold effect related to a critical mass condition, and a hat-shaped relationship (two flat borders around the top) between gender diversity and firm performance. Specifically, firms with balanced diversity (between 40 and 60% women as employees) at the middle management and staff levels tend to be more profitable. Finally, predominantly male firms have similar performance to predominantly female firms, and that balanced-gender diversity is the real contributing factor to firm performance.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.2013922;Boomerang independent contractors: an experimental study using a psychological contract approach. The increasing prevalence of nontraditional work arrangements has led to new talent management challenges for organizations. Given independent contractors (ICs) have the potential to bring considerable value to an organization, it is in an organization's best interest to establish a pool of loyal talent that is willing to return when needed (i.e. as boomerang ICs). Through the lens of the psychological contract, we examine factors that can contribute to retaining independent contractors. Using an international sample of ICs and an experimental research design, we demonstrate that ICs are less likely to return to an organization after a perceived psychological contract breach during a previous project for the same organization. This is especially true if they voluntarily work on a contract basis. Importantly, our results suggest that expectations of both a transactional and relational nature influence independent contractor loyalty to organizations. Our findings extend the limited research on talent management in nontraditional work arrangements, producing important theoretical and practical implications for the management of independent contractors within organizations.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.2001765;Proactive career orientation and physical mobility preference as predictors of important work attitudes: the moderating role of pay satisfaction. Although protean and boundaryless career orientation have been seen mainly as different yet related constructs, a recent meta-analysis suggests a reconsideration of this career concept structure into a distinction between two independent dimensions of 'proactive career orientation' (including sub-dimensions 'self-directed', 'values driven', and 'boundaryless mindset') and 'physical mobility preferences' (including sub-dimension 'organizational mobility preference'). To examine whether or not this new proposed structure is sustained we analyze the dynamics between the boundaryless career orientation (using with subdimensions 'boundaryless mindset' and 'organizational mobility preference') and attitudinal outcomes of organizational commitment, job satisfaction, turnover intention and pay satisfaction. The results provide empirical validation for the propositions in the meta-analysis, not only regarding career concept structure but also its dynamics. They confirm areas of similarity of 'boundaryless mindset' and protean dynamics but also important differences between these dynamics for employees with a mobility preference. Boundaryless mindset employees are more intrinsically motivated and proactive in developing their career. Those having high organizational mobility preference are more extrinsically motivated and reactive when facing organizational and environmental determinants. The results show that a 'traditional' boundaryless career orientation is a two-sided coin and organizations need to differentially manage the diverse profiles of a boundaryless careers.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1976245;Tensions in talent identification: a multi-stakeholder perspective. Research on how organisations identify talent in practice remains limited. Too often it appears that the most core construct - talent - is taken for granted in terms of how key stakeholders make sense of and give meaning to it in practice. This paper examines the talent definitions held by multiple organisational stakeholders and the criteria used in the practice of identification. Drawing from content analysis of over 200 interviews, our findings demonstrate substantial discrepancies between senior leaders' and talents' view on the meaning of talent within organisations. Moreover, there was little awareness of the identification criteria used by decision-makers that gives individuals the talent designation. Given the potential impact of this designation on employee attitudes, behaviours, and performance, the seemingly limited relationship between the meaning ascribed to talent and the identification criteria used in practice is likely to raise concerns about fairness and transparency. The findings indicate the absence of a shared and well-defined talent philosophy which we suggest is needed to guide talent management practices.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We propose a cross-level perspective on the relationship between individual-level perceived camaraderie and organizational-level camaraderie climate which interact to predict employee perceptions of innovativeness. Additionally, organizational gender diversity weakens the cross-level interaction. We tested our hypotheses by conducting a multi-level study with 39,574 employees working in 53 firms in Central America and the Caribbean. The positive link between perceived camaraderie and perceived innovativeness was stronger in firms with higher organizational camaraderie climate, and this interaction was moderated in firms with more gender diversity. We discuss the international human resource management implications of social context for the organizational gender diversity and innovation literature in an often-overlooked region.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1080/09585192.2024.2354829;The effectiveness of well-being-oriented human resource management in the context of telework. Organizations can support employee well-being through a wide variety of HRM practices, which can be summarized as well-being-oriented HRM (WBHRM). It is unclear, however, whether these practices can also foster the well-being of teleworkers. Indeed, due to reduced visibility and salience, it is likely that WBHRM is less or even not effective in the telework context. To prove this assumption, we analyze how strong specific domains of WBHRM are related to different dimensions of employee well-being (including happiness, health, and relational well-being) in a non-telework and telework context. In the telework context, we also analyze the moderating role of telework intensity. Our analyses are based on data from 1,980 German employees at two consecutive points in time. Our findings reveal that the overall relationship between WBHRM and employee well-being in terms of happiness (engagement, job satisfaction) and health (strain) is not weakened in the context of telework. Nevertheless, we found differences in the importance of specific domains to foster happiness and health well-being. In terms of relational well-being, we found that WBHRM is positively related to social isolation in the telework and non-telework context (which is counterintuitive). We did not find support for any moderating effect through telework intensity.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2298244;Understanding technology-driven work arrangements from a complexity perspective: a systematic literature review and an agenda for future research. Organizations are increasingly introducing new work arrangements triggered by fast-paced knowledge acquisition, exponential technological growth, and demographic changes. Even though many studies have provided an in-depth understanding of how technology changed individual forms of modern work (e.g. virtual teams, shared leadership, remote work), the field needs a broader view of what constitutes technology-driven work arrangements and why they are implemented in organizations. The purpose of our paper is to systematically review, structure, and integrate the empirical evidence on current research on technology-driven work arrangements and to identify blind spots, which will serve as a springboard for the further development of the field. Based on our understanding of technology-driven work arrangements as flexible approaches to work within and beyond organizational boundaries that result from technology-driven transformation processes characterized by intensified spread, speed, and depth, we identify 191 studies that meet our inclusion criteria and organize them into six thematic clusters. We integrate our findings into an overarching framework based on complexity theory. We argue that three thematic clusters identified in our systematic literature review (organizational architectures across boundaries, knowledge integration processes across boundaries, and flexible employment relations across organizational boundaries) address an organization's need for external flexibility. In contrast, three other clusters (virtual teams within organizations, virtual communication processes within organizations, and enhancement of self-responsibility of organizational actors) address internal flexibility needs, reflecting the overall goal of technology-driven work arrangements to achieve internal and external flexibility via coordinated and consistent patterns of action across all clusters. We additionally highlight underexplored research opportunities and provide promising avenues for future research.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2255823;Hidden agenda for cross-cultural training: understanding refugees' cross-cultural experience through the capability approach. Cross-cultural training (CCT) is important for facilitating more effective interaction in a foreign country, yet theoretical development around CCT rarely captures modern-day migration trends, such as the refugee crisis. Building on the fact that refugees require extra cross-cultural support, as they rarely have sufficient time and resources to prepare pre-departure, we bring the humanitarian context to the field of international human resource management in general and to CCT literature in particular. Through a multidisciplinary review, we offer a theoretical model based on the capability approach to understand existing studies and guide future research. We especially examine the target social groups for CCT, the various components of the training, engagement by receiving community stakeholders, and the relationship of training to individuals' cross-cultural experiences in a foreign country. CCT is vital for refugees to rebuild their lives and careers in a way that enhances their substantive choices and freedoms to achieve what they value in their new country, and our review suggests scholarship has more work to do to reflect contemporary trends in its theorizing of CCT.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2145911;Examining antecedents of repatriates' job engagement and its influence on turnover intention. Repatriate turnover is a key challenge for Multinational Enterprises (MNEs). While MNEs expect to retain returning employees (i.e. repatriates) and to benefit from new knowledge and experience they bring back from international assignments, a number of studies identify high rates of repatriate turnover intentions. This paper draws insights from social exchange theory and psychological contracts. By using survey data from 221 repatriates from the U.S., the paper presents an empirical study of the antecedents of repatriate turnover. Our findings demonstrate that repatriate perceptions of recognition of foreign experience, involvement, team orientation, and application of knowledge, had a significant impact on turnover intention and this impact was felt through repatriate job engagement i.e. repatriate job engagement significantly mediated the influence of recognition of foreign experience, involvement, team orientation, and application of knowledge on turnover intention. While the study findings contribute to the theoretical underpinnings of the antecedents of repatriate turnover it also informs how MNEs can apply new strategies and initiatives that heighten repatriate retention rates and prevent knowledge slippage and the loss of highly valued people soon after they return from international assignments.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Emotional labour (EL) is garnering increasing attention due to the potential negative consequences on employees and organisations. This is especially prevalent with front-line healthcare workers, resulting in high occupational turnover intention. Our study examines the use of high-involvement work practices (HIWPs), supervisor support and resilience as support resources for front-line nurses' emotional labour and work engagement to mitigate occupational turnover intention among nurses in Australia. Data was collected via a nationwide survey of 2,984 nurses and midwives. A significant positive relationship was identified between EL and occupational turnover intentions, mediated by work engagement. The provision of HIWPs resources, supervisor support and individual resilience play an important role in 'buffering' the negative impact of emotional labour on work engagement and the occupational turnover intention of nurses. The key message of our study demonstrates that multi-level resources, organisational (HIWPs), relational (supervisor support) and individual (employee resilience) are important for mitigating the effects of emotional labour on occupational turnover intentions.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2133967;Health and the intention to retire: exploring the moderating effects of human resources practices. Although health is among the strongest predictors of retirement timing, organizational effects on this relationship are largely unknown. Based on the theory of work adjustment and socioemotional selectivity theory, this study explores the role of human resources practices in the relation between older employees' health and retirement intentions-specifically, their preferred retirement age and their intention to engage in late-career employment after being eligible for pension. Three groups of practices are distinguished: individual development practices (e.g. life-long learning and career development), practices tailoring the transition to retirement (e.g. phased retirement), and practices allowing to continue working in later life (e.g. individualized employment forms). We tested our model with multilevel data from 556 older employees and 661 managers from 101 organizations. Results suggest that healthy employees intend to retire later, if individual development practices are stronger pronounced in the organization. In addition, the positive relation between health and the intention to engage in late-career employment was stronger in organizations that provide more opportunities to continue working. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of retirement intentions and offer practical implications to shape later-life work to the benefit of both organizations and employees.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2119093;Supervisor feedback, relational energy, and employee voice: the moderating role of leader-member exchange quality. Although scholars have attempted to explore supervisor feedback as an antecedent of voice, the underlying mechanism remains under-explored. The current research addresses this critical issue from the perspective of conservation of resources theory by delineating how and when supervisor feedback influences employee voice from an energy perspective. Using dyadic data collected from 671 employees and their 218 direct supervisors in a retailer company, we found that supervisor favorable feedback increases employees' relational energy, which, in turn, promotes employee voice. Conversely, supervisor unfavorable feedback decreases employees' relational energy and inhibits employee voice. Furthermore, we found that leader-member exchange quality is an important boundary condition for the relationship between supervisor favorable feedback and voice via relational energy. These findings highlight the role of energy in the relationship between supervisor feedback and employee voice. They also present implications for management to improve supervisors' skills at providing feedback.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1945653;When do daily unattained tasks boost job performance? The moderating role of employee reflexivity and mindfulness. Although unattained work goals and tasks are often viewed by management as an undesired state, the present paper proposes that daily lack of closure can sometimes boost rather than block job performance. Lack of closure is defined as an employee state or subjective feeling whereby the tasks, goals, or projects of a working day remain incomplete. This state is hypothesized to positively relate to job performance for high trait-level employee reflexivity and high day-level employee mindfulness and to negatively relate to job performance for low reflexivity and low mindfulness. To test expectations, a diary survey study was conducted among 209 employees of different sectors. Results supported both hypotheses but with a different temporal pattern for each moderator: On the one hand, previous-day lack of closure negatively related to day-level performance for low employee mindfulness and positively related to day-level performance for high employee mindfulness. On the other hand, day-level lack of closure negatively related to same-day performance for low employee reflexivity and positively related to same-day performance for high employee reflexivity. Theoretical implications of the findings are discussed and practical recommendations are formulated about how employee reflexivity and mindfulness can be enhanced, for example, though workplace interventions.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Despite the increasing number of studies that address various types of developmental relationships and their outcomes, we still know little about the mechanisms through which these relationships affect career outcomes. We investigated the mediating role of academics' research productivity in the relationship between both developmental network quantity and developmental relationship, and career satisfaction. This study proposed a theoretical model for the aforementioned mechanism, and empirically tested it. Questionnaires were administered in-person to academics across eighteen universities in Turkey and 564 responses were received. Findings revealed that research productivity plays a significant mediating role in the relationship between developmental networks and career satisfaction. Results were evaluated for theoretical contributions and practical implications and discussed with regard to future research in the field.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In response, interviews were conducted with 26 Australian CEOs and senior leaders from the private, public, and non-profit sectors across many industries. Qualitative analysis of the interviews identified themes including viewing employee MH as an individual issue, awareness of implicit bias, creating a safe workplace, ignorance of employee MH and best practices, a belief in the value of caring, use of a broad array of programs, and institutional/contextual factors influencing employee MH. A tension-centered approach was used to understand the themes. Tensions found include privacy concerns and managerial ignorance as opposed to employees feeling free to disclose MH information and finding safety and compassion in responses to employee disclosure;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2018.1559870;The mediating effects of professional and organizational commitment on the relationship between HRM practices and professional employees' intention to stay. Previous literature on professional employees argues that the quality of their work depends on both their organizational and professional commitment. Combining a target similarity and a cognitive approach to HRM, this study examines the mediating effects of these two variables on the relationship between HRM practices and intention to stay. Using a sample of 265 professional auditors working for certified public accountancy firms, we find that organizational commitment mediates the relationship between information-sharing, fair rewards and intention to stay, while the effect of autonomy and recognition is successively mediated by professional commitment and organizational commitment. Training has a direct effect on intention to stay. The implications of these results for the development of an HRM model linking professional employees' organizational and professional commitment, thereby providing the possibility of reconciling organizational efficiency and traditional professional ethics, are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1891113;Workplace bullying of immigrants working in Sweden. The aim of this study was to investigate the risks of being bullied at work based on country of birth, and compared to natives. We used a representative sample of the Swedish workforce collected in the autumn of 2017 (n = 1856). The results showed a more than doubled risk of being bullied for the foreign-born. Coming from a culturally dissimilar country, the risk of becoming a victim of bullying was almost fourfold. The increased risk was only for person-related bullying, indicating a risk of being excluded from the social work environment. From a social identity perspective, foreign-born is a salient out-group easy to single out and with a predatory bullying origin they easily become the scapegoat of the group or just an easy target of frustration. There was a greater risk associated with self-labelling as bullied than with the behavioural experience method. Self-labelling could possibly be construed as a mix of exposure to bullying behaviours, and being discriminated against, making it a less suitable method when studying bullying for minorities. The study shows the importance of working with these issues. It severely affects both individuals and the organization in which the negative treatment is occurring.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2018.1504107;Global alignment or localization? An empirical examination of global reward management in MNEs from a subsidiary perspective. The degree to which multinational enterprises (MNEs) standardize their global management practices results from the interplay between pressures on local adaptation and global alignment. Based on data from reward managers of foreign subsidiaries operating mainly in Europe, the present study examines MNEs' global reward management and influencing factors. Our results show that the impact of localization pressures varies between reward practices, remains stable between the different host countries, and is strongest for benefits. Alignment pressures are strong for all reward practices, remain stable between different home countries, and are strongest for performance-related pay. The degree of alignment and localization pressures is reflected in the extent to which subsidiary practices resemble those of HQs and local competitors. This study suggests to researchers as well as practitioners that global reward management is not a simple choice between standardization and localization;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2401021;Rethinking contexts and institutions for research on human resource management in multinational enterprises in an age of polycrisis: reflections and suggestions. International human resource management (IHRM) has covered two very distinct areas: comparative HRM (comparing HRM between national settings) and HRM in multinational enterprises (MNEs). Existing research has pointed to the multifaceted nature of contextual effects, and how they may differ qualitatively according to locale. This perspective article argues that a distinct and shared theme across this literature is much more than a recognition that many different sets of institutions and/or cultural features can make for viable alternative HRM models. We also consider whether or not MNEs seek to accommodate local realities or work to change them. Developing and broadening inquiry around these concerns may represent a solid way for researching IHRM in an age of polycrisis. Such understandings may be of great value in exploring the relationship between the present global polycrisis and HRM practice. We highlight potential concerns and opportunities for theorizing around the same.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2374008;Work, private, self - towards an integrative framework of accountability: the case of low-status expatriates in precarious employment. Felt accountability, the perceived expectation that one's decisions and actions will be evaluated and rewarded or sanctioned, is a key driver of human behaviour and impacts work-related outcomes such as unethical behaviour and job satisfaction. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the importance of low-status expatriates (LSEs), a vulnerable and neglected group, which is often employed under challenging working conditions in low-status occupations. In this paper, we explore how LSEs experience and manage accountabilities in their often-precarious working lives. We draw on 36 qualitative interviews with LSEs employed in Germany. The data were analysed using a directed content analysis method. Our findings highlight that while LSEs feel less accountable towards stakeholders within their organisation, they experience accountabilities from multiple stakeholders outside their organisation. We demonstrate that while LSEs consider work-related accountabilities, their key accountabilities are rooted in individuals' private lives and can lead to higher degrees of accountability intensity. This study provides unique insights into the importance of private life accountabilities and how these intersect with accountabilities at work. We offer a revised framework of accountability that includes private life as an important dimension to enhance its applicability to LSEs.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2293066;Exploring positive and negative intersectionality effects: an employment study of neurodiverse UK military veterans. Intersectional studies have examined the impact of personal characteristics upon employment experience, but little attention has been given to specificities of the neurodiverse and the military veteran. Both may possess skills and abilities that are desirable but there are several negative stereotypes that impact the acquisition and retention of work. Additionally, talent sourcing practices by employers can favour neurotypical people with a civilian background. Adopting a multi-method approach, this study explores barriers to employment and how they are compounded at the intersection of being a neurodiverse veteran (NDV). We surveyed 232 people with a medically diagnosed condition and conducted 21 semi-structured interviews to explore NDVs' views about how the recruitment process and HR practices impact their employment relationship. Extant studies often depict the intersection of qualities to be disadvantageous for the populations studied, however, our research suggests that NDVs can have highly beneficial work capabilities. Our practical contribution includes the identification of key positive and negative aspects in the employment of NDVs and how organizations can refine their talent sourcing and management. Our theoretical contribution is made through a framework depicting the influences on NDVs' employment relationships and a set of propositions that illuminate the intersectionality of neurodiverse and military veterans at work.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2252317;Premature return of self-initiated expatriates in the spectre of a global crisis: a sensemaking perspective. Global mobility studies have focused on the repatriation of assigned expatriates in multinational organisations overlooking the difficulties that self-initiated expatriates (SIEs) face upon returning home prematurely. Recent converging global crises have demonstrated the precarious and challenging circumstances that SIEs confront when relocating abroad of their own volition without the security and support of an organisation. Applying a sensemaking lens, our qualitative study reveals that a global crisis's volatile and unpredictable nature triggers a sensemaking process for SIEs on whether to withdraw prematurely or remain on assignment. Specifically, we unpack how, in attempting to put structure on what was a highly complex, anxious, and stressful situation, SIEs engaged in a sensemaking process of enactment, selection, and retention in deciding whether to return home early. This process involved interpreting varying contextual cues and emotions in acute conditions, processing conflicting information from a nexus of sensegiving actors, and engaging retrospectively in reflexive frames. Our findings enrich existing work on the challenges of SIE repatriation by illuminating the utility of crisis sensemaking to understand how SIEs navigate premature withdrawal amid crisis conditions.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Researchers are advocating a star performer strategy as a way for human resource professionals to deliver value to their employers. I highlight four concerns (four grains of salt) about applying a star performer strategy. As organizations redesign their workplaces and work policies in the wake of COVID-19, academic researchers have a responsibility to make human resource professionals aware of the risks associated with a star performer strategy. A star performer emphasis might be better viewed as a short-term course correction than a long-term human resource strategy.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2163855;A multi-actor perspective on the effectiveness of human resource management implementation: an empirical analysis based on the ability-motivation-opportunity framework. This study is based on the assumption that human resource (HR) practices are implemented through interactions between a variety of actors involved in the process. Novel insights emerge from the analysis of how interactions between HR managers, line managers (LMs) and employees result in effective implementation of HR practices. Drawing on the ability-motivation-opportunity (AMO) framework, the aim of the study is twofold. First, we investigate the extent to which HR department initiatives-classified into HR ability-enhancing, HR motivation-enhancing and HR opportunity-enhancing-increase LMs' perceived ability, motivation and opportunity to perform in human resource management (HRM). Second, we analyse the role of LMs' AMO on the effective implementation of HR practices assessed in terms of employees' satisfaction with HR practices. We collected data from the HR manager, the line manager and between two and five employees (in total 302 employees) in each of the 100 Spanish companies in our sample. Our results reveal that HR motivation-enhancing initiatives increase LMs' motivation;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The ongoing pandemic has brought the world into a paralytical scenario except for the health care workers, which turned their 'nights into nightmares'. The pervasiveness of stress, anxiety, and depression among the frontline healthcare fraternity is a significant concern for the stakeholders in the healthcare sector. The physical, mental, and emotional well-being of these COVID warriors are at stake due to the protracted period of exposure to the pandemic. This study explores the moderating roles of resonant leadership (RL) and workplace spirituality (WPS) on the constructs, psychological distress (PD), and organizational commitment (OC).

This study is an experiment that examines the effects of positive reference, information about predictive validity, and their interaction on how HR professionals evaluate selection methods. It contributes to understanding why HR practitioners use personnel selection methods that are considered to have low predictive validity. A sample of 173 HR professionals from the Czech Republic was asked to evaluate six selection methods that could be used to select a project manager for a telecommunications company. Each participant was randomly assigned to two experimental conditions as the selection methods were presented together with/without positive reference and with/without information about their predictive validity. The results of repeated measures ANOVAs with two between-subjects factors, one within-subject factor, and their interactions showed that information about predictive validity did not significantly influence how HR professionals evaluated selection methods. The analyses also did not support the effect of positive reference on the evaluation of methods with low validity. In contrast, the analyses provided support for the effect of positive reference on the evaluation of selection methods with high predictive validity. The interaction of reference and information about validity had no significant effect on the evaluation of selection methods by HR professionals.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1080/09585192.2022.2081060;Optimizing cultural intelligence development by considering different types of change. Increasing globalization and cultural diversity have accentuated the importance of developing cross-cultural competencies like cultural intelligence (CQ). Typically, scholars and professionals have viewed and operationalized CQ development as a quantitative change in mean CQ scores over time. This work argues that research and practice will benefit from expanding the operationalization of CQ development to include CQ reconceptualization and CQ measurement recalibration because these types of change are also integral to the CQ development process. This work highlights that by not examining the presence of CQ reconceptualization and CQ measurement recalibration before examining changes in mean CQ scores over time, scholars and practitioners could fail to recognize the presence of CQ development when it happens, create a threat to the substantive interpretation offindings, and further contribute to the inconsistent and conflicting research results. Methodologies for assessing different types of change in CQ development are discussed with implications for improving cross-cultural competence research and practice. The main contribution of this work lies in providing ways for improving the rigor of CQ development studies to enhance the quality of CQ development research and practice.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2066981;Embedding transparency in artificial intelligence machine learning models: managerial implications on predicting and explaining employee turnover. Employee turnover (ET) is a major issue faced by firms in all business sectors. Artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning (ML) prediction models can help to classify the likelihood of employees voluntarily departing from employment using historical employee datasets. However, output responses generated by these AI-based ML models lack transparency and interpretability, making it difficult for HR managers to understand the rationale behind the AI predictions. If managers do not understand how and why responses are generated by AI models based on the input datasets, it is unlikely to augment data-driven decision-making and bring value to the organisations. The main purpose of this article is to demonstrate the capability of Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) technique to intuitively explain the ET predictions generated by AI-based ML models for a given employee dataset to HR managers. From a theoretical perspective, we contribute to the International Human Resource Management literature by presenting a conceptual review of AI algorithmic transparency and then discussing its significance to sustain competitive advantage by using the principles of resource-based view theory. We also offer a transparent AI implementation framework using LIME which will provide a useful guide for HR managers to increase the explainability of the AI-based ML models, and therefore mitigate trust issues in data-driven decision-making.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This study provides a theoretical model illustrating how high involvement work systems (HIWS) influence organizational performance on the knowledge combination capability perspective based on the resource-based view. We collected data from employees and managers from a sample of 147 companies, which had a total of 739 employees and 471 middle/high level managers. Our results indicate that HIWS had a significant and positive relation with organizational performance, and knowledge combination capability fully mediated its relationship. We also find that interaction orientation positively moderates the relationship between HIWS and knowledge combination capability. In addition, interaction orientation positively moderates the indirect effect of HIWS on organization creativity through knowledge combination capability. We discuss the theoretical contribution and practical implications and future studies.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Despite the growth in the severity and incidence of mental health conditions (MHCs) in wider society and within workplaces, relatively little research has focused on how organizations accommodate employees' MHCs, and how different approaches to accommodating MHCs contribute to their stigmatization. Drawing on in-depth interviews with HR managers from a variety of organizational contexts in Australia, our findings show that approaches to accommodating MHCs vary systematically across organizations, and that common approaches to accommodating employees with MHCs unintentionally stigmatize both employees with MHCs, and MHCs more generally. We identify two new forms of structural stigma, which we respectively label business-based structural stigma and care-based structural stigma, that stem from transactional and paternalist approaches to accommodating employees' MHCs. We explore the implications for de-stigmatizing MHCs in workplaces and for future HRM research that advances understanding of how organizations can better support employees with MHCs.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Although human capital has been widely recognized as a valuable asset that helps firms to develop core competences to achieve competitive advantage, little is known about how HR (human resource) practices enhance employee capabilities in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Building upon the resource-based view of HRM (human resources management) and the proactivity literature, we explore the effects of the HR system as an integration of bundles of HR practices on employee capability and how employee proactivity helps explain this relationship in the SME context. Using survey data collected from 213 employees working in service SMEs in New Zealand, we applied partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) to test our hypothesis. The results show that the HR system in SMEs facilitates employee proactivity with this, in turn, enhancing employee job capability. Our findings suggest that the HR system, as a source of human capital, is important for SMEs to exploit. Specifically, our findings validate the notion that the HR system is beneficial to employee capability through facilitating a proactivity mechanism in the SME context. These findings yield both theoretical and managerial implications, which are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Drawing on the identity perspective, we investigate the roles of organizational and moral identification in the relationship between abusive supervision and subordinates' organizational deviance. By conducting a multiwave study of 182 subordinate-supervisor dyads, we found that organizational identification partially mediated the relationship between abusive supervision and subordinates' organizational deviance after controlling for perceived leader social support as an alternative mediator. In addition, we demonstrated that organizational identification interacted with moral identification in affecting organizational deviance in the workplace and that moral identification moderated the indirect effect of abusive supervision on organizational deviance via organizational identification. However, we did not find a mediating effect of moral identification, and we call for future studies to explore the impact of more specific facets of identities in abusive supervision situations. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Even though several differences exist between co-operatives and capitalist enterprises, such as the democratic governance style of the co-operatives, both types of enterprises compete with each other. In this context, how can the co-operatives distinguish themselves from private enterprises? Based on the AMO bundles model (for Abilities, Motivation and Opportunity to participate) and on the three-component model of organizational commitment, this study collected data from 578 respondents of financial service co-operatives in eastern Canada. This research had two primary objectives. First, it seeks to examine if employees perceive a co-operative difference through HRM practices which influences their commitment. Second, it aims to evaluate the relations between HRM practices, employees' perception of a co-operative difference, and their organizational commitment through the influence of some socio-demographic variables. The main findings are that: (1) the employees perceived a co-operative difference through HRM practices that influenced their commitment;art;" (4) the employees with union membership displayed lower affective and normative commitment."",art";;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Working from home (WFH) has accelerated in occurrence following social distancing measures directed at stemming the spread of Covid-19 globally. Using a sample of 41 in-depth qualitative interviews and measurement of the personality scores of the 41 interviewees, who are UK academics, using the IPIP test questionnaire, we explored how mandatory WFH impacts the boundary management of different academics based on their personality and the role of personality in their boundary-management approach to enhance work-life balance (WLB) during Covid-19. Our results suggest that mandatory WFH impacts academics differently depending on their personality, with academics high in conscientiousness and introversion (compared to their neurotic and extroverted colleagues) more suited to managing work and life domains to maintain a WLB while working from home. Building on boundary theory, we uncovered that while conscientious and introverted academics preferred and used integration as their boundary-management style, extroverted academics preferred segmentation in favor of family, but used volleying as a boundary-management style. Neurotic academics leaned toward our newly uncovered boundary-management style - quitter. Our findings suggest that the family circumstances of academics play an important role in their boundary-management styles. Overall, our study suggests relationships between personality and boundary-management styles and characteristics.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2416523;The potential dark side of remote work transformation: a social vulnerability and relational perspective. The global COVID-19 pandemic led many organizations and employees to abruptly adopt remote work. This remote work transformation has broadly encompassed individuals from a diverse range of backgrounds (e.g. ethnicity, gender) and job roles. A multi-level, conceptual model is developed that explores its potential dark side, particularly for women and ethnic minorities. Drawing on social vulnerability theory and the relational framework of diversity, this manuscript explores how disproportionate exposure to remote work, surveillance and disciplinary mechanisms, along with adverse job and wage loss, job insecurity, and psychological health impacts for women and ethnic minorities may potentially permeate their workplace interactions and stimulate interpersonal conflict. Moreover, this model incorporates these relationships within their broader social context, shaped by the legislative framework and shared cultural beliefs such as social difference codes. Nevertheless, this model elucidates how certain organizational approaches to diversity management can potentially alleviate these disproportionate outcomes. Theoretical implications, future research directions, and recommendations for policy and practice are highlighted.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2361710;Different systems, similar experiences: felt accountability in labor platforms and traditional organizations. Accountability systems are the core mechanisms by which workers are motivated and controlled. Sourced from customer ratings and powered by algorithmic control, the accountability systems of labor platforms are a substantial departure from those designed by human resources departments for use in traditional organizations. While considerable attention has been paid to the impacts of algorithmic control, it is ultimately a worker's felt accountability that influences their behaviors and attitudes in the workplace. However, to date, there has been an absence of theory that explains how labor platforms' accountability systems result in felt accountability. As such, our paper starts with an examination of the underexplored link between accountability systems and workers' felt accountability. We next argue that features of the accountability environment (source, intensity, salience, and focus) can be described both objectively and phenomenologically. We then make use of this distinction to detail the differences between the accountability systems of labor platforms and traditional organizations and theorize about resultant differences in workers' felt accountability. Finally, we discuss implications for the accountability and human resource management literatures, including the importance of the unexpected similarity between traditional workers' and platform workers' felt accountability.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2323510;Flexible work arrangements and employee turnover intentions: contrasting pathways. This study examines the associations between flexible work arrangements (FWAs) and turnover intentions by testing four perspectives with consideration of the subprocess (i.e. indirect effects) that each conveys. Multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) was applied to test the direct, indirect, and total effects of flextime, telecommuting, and overall flexibility on turnover intentions (n1 = 1,505 employees, n2 = 64 work units). Support was found for the subprocesses that involved job control and work engagement. Flexibility was associated with more job control and work engagement which were in turn related to lower turnover intentions. That telecommuting was associated with higher work-to-family conflict and indirectly to higher turnover intentions raised questions about the net effects of flexibility. The discussion recasts the narratives that have guided research into the possible outcomes of work arrangements that provide flexibility.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we shed light on how non-binary people express their gender identity in the workplace by drawing on self-discrepancy and self-verification theories. We argue that non-binary workers may experience a discrepancy between their actual and ideal expression of their gender identity at work and be motivated to prevent this due to a desire for others to see them as they see themselves. A mixed quantitative/qualitative survey of 160 non-binary workers in the UK and USA reveals that there are various ways non-binary workers express their gender identity at work via physical appearance and clothing, gestures and language, posture and movement, and other communication signals. However, most non-binary workers may perceive a moderate level of discrepancy between their current and ideal-future expression of their gender identity at work. We find that such discrepancies are less likely to occur when organizations promote supportive gender identity related HRM practices (such as flexible dress code and pronoun policies), co-worker allyship, and job autonomy. Overall, we contribute to knowledge about how non-binary people view their gender identity expression at work and what HR practitioners, managers, and co-workers can do to support them.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2250261;A paradox perspective on talent management: a multi-level analysis of paradoxes and their responses in talent management. With this paper, we aim to challenge the current theorizing in talent management (TM) that has generally been based on oversimplified assumptions, often approaching TM from a binary or an either/or perspective. We claim that adopting a paradox lens in which a both/and perspective is taken is essential to further deepen our theoretical understanding of the ill-understood tensions and ambiguities that are inherently part of managing talent. In this article, we take a paradox perspective to unravel the complexity of talent management by systematically reviewing the nature and prominence of paradoxes and their response mechanisms in the talent management literature and from the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and organizational levels. We identified six primary paradoxes: (a) opportunities vs. pressures (at the intrapersonal level);art; (d) exclusiveness vs. inclusiveness; (e) transparency vs. ambiguity;" and (f) standardization vs. customization (at the organizational level). Our review resulted in a multi-level framework of paradoxes in talent management and responds to calls for more pluralistic and balanced approaches to talent management. We believe that our review can assist researchers in adopting both/and perspectives when studying the complexity of the talent management phenomenon and can assist TM practitioners in navigating multiple paradoxes that are inherent to managing talent."",art";;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper sought is to provide a unique examination of what constitutes extreme work for the HR professional, and in turn the extent to which HR professionals are engaged in such work. Granter et al. (2019) multidimensional theoretical framework of work intensity (organizational, temporal, emotional and physical) challenges was used as an anchor to explore and understand these issues. The paper is based on a thematic analysis of interviews with Australian HR professionals capturing the nature, complexity and intensity of their role, and the implications on the HR professional, inclusive of those resulting from the dark side of HR. Granter et al. (2019) work intensity challenges (organisational, temporal, emotion and physical) were found to be intrinsic to the role of the HR professional;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2163418;High-performance work system and transformational leadership for employee constructive voice: unique and relative importance in a high-power distance context. Constructive employee voice is important but challenging to promote in high power distance contexts. The unique and relative importance of HRM systems and leadership in promoting it is more generally little understood. This study investigates the unique and relative importance of a high-performance work system (HPWS) and transformational leadership (TL) for constructive employee voice behavior, as well as how individual-level power distance orientation (PDO) moderates those relationships. The analyses are based on a sample of 403 subordinates of middle managers in 232 domestic Russian organizations. The results show that both TL and HPWS relate positively to employee voice, but most importantly that HPWS is more strongly so related, that it significantly substitutes the relationship between TL and voice, and that the relationship between HPWS and voice is further strengthened by employee PDO. We also conducted post-hoc qualitative interviews with 25 employees in domestic Russian organizations to triangulate our quantitative results. The study contributes to research on employee voice, in particular to research on the relative importance of its antecedents, and to the emerging body of research that simultaneously considers HRM and leadership.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2163464;Personal disposition as the source of variability in the hrm-performance relationship: the moderating effects of conscientiousness on the relationship between high-commitment work system and employee outcome. Despite a growing interest in examining why and how variability within organizations develops throughout HR implementation, attempts hitherto appear futile. We evaluate that it is attributed to the with-organization level HRM research, overly skewed towards delineating the mediating processes. It is, as we argue, imperative to directly capture the sources and consequences of the discrepancy in the HRM-performance relationship to enrich our understanding of the phenomena and, more importantly, intervene more strategically in practice. To that end, we investigate how employee conscientiousness systematically changes the relationship between workgroup-level HR practices and employee affective commitment, subsequently conducive to task performance. Our analyses of time-lagged, multilevel data demonstrated that the indirect HRM-commitment-performance link turns significant only when the level of conscientiousness is factored in. Further, we found that motivation-enhancing HR practices are more effective for those low on conscientiousness, whereas high-conscientious individuals perform better under the influence of opportunity-enhancing HR practices. In our sample, the ability-enhancing HR bundle did not work together with conscientiousness either way. The current study is indeed a meaningful pursuit as one of the early attempts to draw a more nuanced picture of idiosyncratic employee responses.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2019.1674357;Big data contributions to human resource management: a systematic review. Big Data (BD) has become a valuable resource for companies. Publications on BD have grown enormously but scholarly work is scarce. The present review aims to systematise the academic inputs so far and to clarify what is the novelty of BD, what are its implications and challenges for HRM practices, and in which HR practice systems the main contributions are. In a systematic search of more than 1,500 documents, we found 41 articles studying BD in Human Resource Management (HRM). Results show that BD means a new approach and methodology to manage data on employees and numerous opportunities for HRM, but also important challenges at a technological, methodological and ethical level. Five main clusters of HR practice systems have been identified, concentrating the largest number of papers in the cluster of information, learning and knowledge and in the cluster of strategy, efficiency and performance, suggesting a trend in the studies that is explained by the nature and characteristics of the BD. The steps to carry out BD projects are described. The main contributions of the BD in each area are described and future research avenues are outlined.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1986106;Human Capital resource as cost or investment: A market-based analysis. This study empirically investigates the myopic behavior of the stock market toward firms' human capital resource investment, paying particular attention to two key proxies: human resource expenditure and the firm value added allocated to the employees. Focusing on human capital resource investment decisions' alignment with near versus longer-term emphasis by investors, we examine firms listed in the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100 over a five-year period using an established accounting-based valuation model. Our results show that human capital investment discourse leads to overweighting of the forecasted longer-term earnings in the apportionment of share price constituents, suggesting that investors consider investment in employees to generate more return in the longer-term. Additionally, our findings prove that investors respond to firm level human capital resource as an investment generating more return in the longer-term. This emphasises the importance of communicating human capital resource investment information that accurately reflects the firm value creation via employees in external financial reporting.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This study focuses on distinctive themes of career success and their relationship with fundamental societal logics. Drawing on theoretical insights from neo-institutionalism, and adopting a mixed-method approach based on semi-structured interviews and questionnaire surveys with Chinese managers, we conducted a qualitative and quantitative study on the meaning of career success in a typical 'hybrid' society. In contrast with understandings of career success centred on market-based logics, our analysis highlights the complex, reflective relationship between career success themes and societal logics. The results indicate that among the identified career success themes, traditional logics and their market-based counterparts coexist, and are consistent with each other in some ways and conflicting in others. The results further show that the reflection of societal logics in derivative meanings, in contrast to that in core meanings, is more institutionally contextualised and, therefore, less consistent. Our study adds to the understanding of how social contexts shape the meaning of career success, and has important implications for career and human resource management research and practice.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2019.1579249;Socially irresponsible human resource management? Conceptualising HRM practice and philosophy in relation to in-work poverty in the UK. This article is motivated by extant literature on how first-world countries, such as the UK, increasingly face problems with poverty arising from employment (in-work poverty). The main problem addressed by this article concerns making a clearer conceptual link between HRM philosophy and practice and in-work poverty. To address this conceptual problem, life history interviews (n = 27) were conducted with employees experiencing in-work poverty, due to their effectiveness at explaining why people get into low pay cycles. Based on a lens built through consulting literature on socially responsible HRM (SRHRM) and in-work poverty, the findings demonstrate a conceptual link between HRM philosophy and practice and in-work poverty, resulting in a proposed model of socially irresponsible HRM (SIHRM). We suggest that, negative and important employee outcomes from forms of SIHRM arise not just in the work setting, but also at the work-life interface. The article has implications in terms of informing a range of HRM and in-work poverty debates. Further research and the testing of the ideas generated through this article is recommended before concluding on the wider implications of a model of HRM based on social irresponsibility.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2018.1528556;Meaningful careers in social enterprises in remote Australia: employment decisions among Australian Indigenous art centre workers. This research investigates why Indigenous workers decide to enter, stay or leave their positions in art centres that serve as important social enterprises in remote Australia. We develop a framework that integrates identity theory and push-pull theory via institutional logics, thereby extending Wry and York (2017)'s typology configurations that is applicable to other actors in the entrepreneurial eco-system, including Indigenous art centre workers. Based on a qualitative study of 72 Indigenous art centre workers employed in remote Australia, the results indicate that although art centres have dual for-profit and social missions, it is mainly pull factors related to paid, local employment aligned to vocational interests, and pro-social motives that are important in explaining why Indigenous Australians choose to work there. Career motives also explain workers' decision to stay, while diverse pull and push factors explain why workers quit. Importantly, the factors that explain employment decisions are multi-factorial, interrelated and closely tied to the social and cultural logics of community life. The research furthers our understanding of how identity factors contribute to decisions by Indigenous art centres workers to enter, leave or stay in their role, providing a more complete understanding of HRM within the context of social enterprises.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2330991;Do employees and firms benefit from autonomous work practice? Curvilinear effects on collective turnover and productivity of firms. The present study focuses on the opportunity dimension of the ability-motivation-opportunity framework and explores the implications of autonomous work practice (AWP) for the collective turnover and productivity of firms. Given the trade-offs between the costs and benefits of AWP and its potential double-edged sword effects, we adopt the interdisciplinary perspective on job design (i.e. mechanistic and motivational models) as basis to theorize the curvilinear effects of AWP. We further hypothesize the interaction between AWP and work flexibility, consistent with the internal fit perspective of strategic human resource management. The current framework is validated by analyzing multisource, time-lagged data collected from 1,240 firms over a two-year period. The analysis confirms the hypothesized curvilinear effects of AWP, in which collective turnover is low only when the level of AWP is moderate. The detriment of a high level of AWP on increasing collective turnover is amplified for firms with low work flexibility. By contrast, firm productivity is high when the AWP level is either low or high, and the benefit of a high level of AWP on increasing productivity is pronounced for firms with high work flexibility.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2274659;Language in international human resource management: current state of research and future research directions. Research on language in international business has grown substantially during the last two decades. However, research that links language to human resource management (HRM) has remained scarce. This is unfortunate because attracting, developing, motivating, and retaining a multilingual workforce is essential for the long-term success of organizations in today's global business world. The present special issue on language in international HRM contributes to tackling this gap. We provide an overview of the current state of research on language in nternational HRM and preview the papers in this special issue. Building on and extending current knowledge, we propose future research directions in terms of 1) a nuanced understanding of HRM functions, 2) language as part of multinational diversity management, 3) consideration of different actors and different contexts, 4) robust theorizing at multiple levels, and 5) more diverse methods to capture complex realities of a multilingual workforce.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2254212;Breach not only affects you: the influence of coworker psychological contract breach by the supervisor on third-party perceptions of supervisor interactional justice. Understanding and effectively responding to employee psychological contract (PC) breach is a critical task for human resource (HR) managers. Drawing on social information processing theory and the deontic theory of justice and using two separate studies, Study 1 (an experiment) and Study 2 (a two-wave field study), the study proposes and tests a conceptualization that helps to explicate the implications of PC breach from the perspective of the third-party employee. Specifically, supporting our hypotheses, we found that when a third-party observer perceives a coworker's PC breach perpetrated by their common focal supervisor that this negatively influences the third-party's perceptions of the supervisor's interactional justice (i.e., both interpersonal and informational) and that such a relationship is moderated by the extent of the third-party's guanxi with the supervisor. Moreover, our findings further reveal that when a third-party observer with high guanxi with the supervisor also has a high power distance orientation (PDO), that the negative effects associated with the perceived coworker PC breach will be weakened. The study not only responds to scholars' calls but it improves understanding of how the relational context may distort third-party perceptions of social treatment and justice-related behavior. Implications to theory, practice, and future research are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2237878;Managing legitimacy in a cross-border post-merger integration context: the role of language strategies. This paper develops a conceptual framework of language strategies in the cross-border post-merger and acquisition (M & A) context as firms seek legitimacy for integration from their internal stakeholders. We contribute by developing a framework for advancing the debate that cross-border bidder firms employ rationalistic and nationalistic rationales to legitimise their M & A choices, including the role of language, which is an embodiment of culture to help create synergies in a post-merger integration (PMI) context. Based on our review of social identity, legitimacy, and strategic integration literature, our conceptual model outlines language strategies to achieve the twin goals of PMI and legitimising their choices. We offer a critical review of the approaches used in cross-border PMI and integrate the role of language in gaining legitimacy for the internal stakeholders, such as its impact on employees and managers. From an international human resource management perspective, we highlight the importance of language strategies for each of the four integration scenarios for the bidder and target firm employees and managers, primarily when neither the target nor the bidder firm uses English as their native language. Finally, we develop propositions to advance future research in this area. The role of international language training and other approaches is also highlighted.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2064718;Fostering assigned expatriates' innovativeness via culturally intelligent supervisors: a resource gain perspective. Assigned expatriates play a role in the innovations of multinational companies (MNCs). Yet, we still know little about how MNCs can help their expatriates towards being more innovative. In this study, we draw on conservation of resources theory to propose that perceived host country national (HCN) supervisor cultural intelligence (CQ), as a contextual resource, positively influences expatriates' innovativeness via two personal resource pathways. Specifically, we suggest that expatriates' work engagement and subsidiary socialization, as corresponding personal energy and personal knowledge pathways, positively mediate between perceived HCN supervisor CQ and expatriate innovativeness. We further hypothesize that expatriate cultural metacognition, as a key resource, helps expatriates utilize contextual resources more effectively to generate personal resources to innovate, and thus, it positively moderates the two mediation pathways. We use time-lagged data collected from assigned expatriates to test our hypotheses. We discuss our theoretical and practical contributions to the international human resource management literature.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2054283;High performance work systems, employee creativity and organizational performance in the education sector. Education is a key pillar of social and economic development. In recent years, this sector has come under increasing pressure to provide improved and more relevant services. High performance work systems (HPWS) are deemed critical in order to meet these demands. Additionally, teachers are expected to be more creative in approaching their work which, it is argued, will improve performance at the school level. Nevertheless, little research has been conducted to understand how to enhance employee creativity, and whether creativity will improve the education sector's organizational performance. In addressing this gap, we conducted research in the education sector in China, collecting data from 59 public schools, over 1,000 teachers and just under 5,000 students. This multi-source dataset was analysed utilizing three-level structural equation modelling. The results support our hypotheses that HPWS enhance teacher creativity and subsequently improve student quality of school life indirectly through teacher job performance. The findings provide new insights into the value of strategic human resource management and the importance of creativity in the education sector.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2054287;Developing inclusive and healthy organizations by employing designated lived experience roles: Learning from human resource management innovations in the mental health sector. Employees' mental health issues present significant challenges for organizations globally. Despite various human resource management (HRM) interventions, systemic stigmatization of people with mental health challenges endures. We propose drawing on an innovative HRM practice in the mental health sector, by introducing designated lived experience (LE) roles into organizations to achieve cultural shifts that benefit the entire workforce. A sector-wide survey was conducted across the mental health sector within an Australian state. A whole-workforce approach was taken by seeking perspectives from employees in both LE roles and traditional roles. Complete responses were obtained from 327 participants (116 in LE roles and 211 in traditional roles). Results showed that across the entire workforce, top leader commitment to LE roles led to more clarity about LE roles, resulting in improved individual outcomes of authentic self-expression, and organizational outcomes of service delivery. LE role clarity was particularly important in organizational contexts where social integration of LE roles was low. Our study puts lived experience at the forefront of HRM scholarly debate, highlighting how employing LE roles can achieve better performance, diversity and inclusion outcomes especially for those with mental health challenges, and support the development of more healthy and inclusive organizations.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2045620;Examining work-home segmentation as a coping strategy for frontline workers: a mixed method study of social workers across Australia. Recent scholarship has shown the prevalence of work-family conflict among social workers caused by their intense job demands. Correspondingly, academics and practitioners alike have recommended work-home segmentation as an effective coping strategy to help social workers deal with work-family conflict. Drawing on the stressor-strain-outcome framework, we first conducted Study 1 using a survey of 504 social workers to test psychological strain as a mediator of the relationship between work-family conflict and job performance, and to examine if work-home segmentation buffered the mediating relationship. Contrary to prior studies, work-home segmentation only alleviated work-family conflict for some social workers, but intensified the psychological strain and reduced the job performance of other social workers. To probe this finding further, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 social workers in Study 2 to understand why work-home segmentation did not reduce their psychological strain. The interviews revealed that most struggled to detach themselves psychologically and emotionally from work at home. The inability to implement work-home segmentation thus became an additional stressor, and they also engaged in after-hours work-related rumination. Therefore, we encourage organisations and managers to adopt a nuanced approach when advocating work-home segmentation as a coping strategy for frontline workers to deal with work-family conflict.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1991434;The moral dark side of performance pressure: how and when it affects unethical pro-organizational behavior. Drawing on social cognitive theory of moral conduct, we hypothesize that performance pressure is positively associated with unethical pro-organizational behavior (UPB) through the mediation of moral justification beyond that of self-serving cognitions. We further hypothesize that creative cognitive style enhances this relationship, whereas moral identity ameliorates the moderating effect of creative cognitive style. The findings from two field studies involving multi-wave data provide convergent support for our hypotheses. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This study examines the psychological contracts held by expatriates with low socioeconomic status. We develop and test a moderated mediation model that examines the direct relationship between organisational support and intention to leave via the mediating role of psychological contract fulfilment. We also examine the moderating role of transactional psychological contracts on this indirect relationship in a sample of 108 low-status expatriates in the United Arab Emirates. Our results validate the assumptions made in psychological contract theory on the direct effect of organisational support and contract fulfilment. However, contrary to our expectations, the findings revealed a positive relationship between contract fulfilment and intention to leave. We discuss the implications of these mixed results for theory and practice.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1080/09585192.2021.1958248;Developing a framework for responsible downsizing through best fit: the importance of regulatory, procedural, communication and employment responsibilities. The COVID-19 crisis has caused a wave of redundancies globally. This has brought the organisational practice of downsizing into sharp relief. Responsible downsizing is broadly understood as the actions, practices and strategies adopted by organisations to ameliorate the negative effects of redundancy. The paper draws on HR theories of best practice and best fit to explore the phenomenon of responsible downsizing, as a dominant focus in extant literature is the identification of 'responsible' best practices. In challenging these prevailing assumptions, this paper contends that responsible downsizing is more usefully understood as theoretically underpinned by a best fit approach. While there is value in adopting best practices the paper argues that greater attention should be paid to how organisational, societal and institutional contexts shape their implementation. Based on a review of 44 empirical articles, the paper advances a framework for responsible downsizing. The framework establishes four types of responsibility: regulatory, procedural, communication and employment responsibilities. Critical areas for future research are also mapped along with conceptual and practical implications.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1910535;Conflict and socio-cultural adaptation: the mediating and moderating role of conflict communication behaviors and cultural intelligence. Interpersonal interactions of global employees are critical for Socio-Cultural Adaptation (SCA) and effective human resources management in the international environment. To date, research examining the impact of interpersonal process of conflict in effective socio-cultural adaptation in the global environment is limited. In this study, we argue that conflict is pervasive in interpersonal interactions and is likely to impact the success of global employees' SCA. We propose that employees' communication and cultural intelligence play important mediating and moderating roles in the link between conflict and SCA. Findings from 241 global organizational employees from over 30 countries suggest that conflict and communication are directly related to SCA. Additionally, aspects of employees' communication behaviors mediated the link between conflict and SCA, while aspects of cultural intelligence moderated the link between conflict communication behaviors and SCA. These findings extend the literature on SCA and contribute to the further development of the concept of cultural intelligence in relation to human resource management. The implications of our findings for international human resource management are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This quantitative study explores the antecedents of service employees' work engagement and the impacts of these antecedents, from the perspective of positive organizational behavior and the job demands-resources model. Survey data were collected from frontline service employees and managers at selected branches of a chain restaurant in Northern Taiwan. Hierarchical linear modeling revealed that frontline employees' psychological capital mediated the positive relationship between branch managers' servant leadership and employees' work engagement. Moreover, nonmanagerial employees' work engagement mediated the relationship between their psychological capital and their service performance. The implications of this study for theory and practice are discussed, along with possible directions for future research.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2018.1505761;How fast do apprenticeships come to a premature end? Insights into the factors that determine the speed of the process. This study draws on data on dual apprenticeship training in Germany to investigate which factors determine how fast the decision to terminate an apprenticeship before its completion is taken and executed. Information on the speed of this process can help organizations improve their decision-making in taking measures aimed at preventing premature terminations. As the results of our probit regression show, the decision to terminate an apprenticeship early is likely to be implemented in less than two months if the sole initiator of the termination is the apprentice and the decision is made within the probationary period or during the first year of the apprenticeship. Our analysis also shows that dissatisfaction with the quality of training increases the probability of a swift termination. In contrast, when the reason is unsatisfactory performance on the part of the apprentice at the vocational school, the process of premature termination is likely to be significantly slower.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2020.1845776;Human resource capabilities in uncertain environments. Increasingly, multinational companies (MNCs) are entering less explored markets with highly uncertain environments. In such an environment, MNCs must develop new solutions to tackle unpredictable changes. While there are some studies focusing on firm strategies in turbulent environments, there is a scant understanding of how the human resource strategies of MNCs should change in precarious environments. Thus, built upon the dynamic capability perspective, we focus on the human resource capabilities that MNCs develop in an uncertain emerging economy. In this research, we carried out a multiple case study and interviewed six MNCs' subsidiaries operating in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Our findings demonstrate that in an uncertain environment, human resource managers should be able to develop flexible cost management, adapt compensation packages, employ frequent and transparent communication, ensure retention of their top-quality managers, develop long-term oriented team-based and quick decision-making, and have the autonomy from MNC headquarters to enact these initiatives.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2018.1504106;The Job Seeking Experiences of International Graduates in the Host Country: Australia's Lost Opportunity?. This paper examines the job seeking experiences of international graduates in attempting to obtain meaningful work in their university education host country. Qualitative feedback on the specific job seeking barriers and experiences in the host country after graduating were provided by 696 respondents. The findings suggest that the specific barriers to finding employment were their visa status, lack of work experience and perceived discriminatory practices of potential employers and/or their agents. The study also suggests that the discriminatory employment experiences of international university graduates demonstrate a lack of congruence between the concept of best fit in hiring decision making and a culturally diverse Australian labour market. Not only do the current practices limit the source of potential highly educated, skilled and culturally aware employees into the labour market of the host country, it also severely compromises an organisation's ability to achieve workplace diversity;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Using representative German employee data, we analyze the role of works councils for the incidence of severance payments subsequent to dismissals. While there is a positive relation with severance payments after those dismissals which stem from plant closings, the incidence of a works council is negatively associated with severance pay subsequent to individual layoffs. In both cases, we find a negative moderating effect of individuals' higher re-employment chances. We also explore gender differences and differences between the types of previously held jobs.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1080/09585192.2024.2427146;Proactivity or withdrawal? The role of attributions in employee psychological and behavioral responses to leader high performance expectations. In today's fiercely competitive market landscape, leader high performance expectations (LHPEs) are increasingly integrated into performance management practices in the workplace. However, this adoption may yield a performance management paradox: while some argue that high performance expectations prompt proactive employee engagement, others assert that such expectations induce withdrawal. Our study aims to unveil this paradox and its underlying mechanisms. Drawing upon insights from the HR attributions literature and the job demands-resources model, we propose that the impact of LHPE is contingent upon employees' attributions for this practice. Specifically, employees attributing LHPE to prosocial motives experience a sense of thriving at work, leading to increased engagement in proactive behavior (the motivational pathway). Conversely, those attributing LHPE to self-interest motives experience distress at work and tend to withdraw (the strain pathway). Our hypotheses are supported by the results of a three-wave survey involving 321 employees. Overall, our findings underscore the crucial role of employee attributions in implementing LHPE as a performance management strategy, offering insights into its optimal utilization.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2401582;The role of previous experience in the analysis of the psychological contract and its outcomes during the socialization process: a signalling theory perspective. Psychological contract theory has largely neglected the role of previous experience. In this study, we examine how previous work experience influences outcomes of communication with organizational insiders during organizational socialization among healthcare staff. We develop a model based on signalling theory, within which information acquisition during socialization is associated with psychological contract fulfilment, which is in turn is related to better health, happiness, and social relationships. Moderated mediation analysis based on data collected at entry and three months later confirms indirect effects between three types of information acquisition and three employee outcomes via the mediating role of psychological contract fulfilment. Importantly, these indirect effects are present only for inexperienced newcomers. Our findings build on signalling theory and add to knowledge about how the psychological contract forms during early socialization. They also suggest that organizations should pay particular attention to inducting inexperienced newcomers.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2347645;Reexamining the relationship between extrinsic rewards and creativity: a study from the creative process engagement perspective. Empirical findings concerning the effects of extrinsic rewards on employee creativity have been controversial and have focused mainly on the theoretical mechanism of intrinsic motivation. Although intrinsic motivation is a primary impetus for creativity, generating creative outputs is a process that requires a sequence of creative endeavors. Drawing from the componential theory of creativity, this study proposes a positive relationship between extrinsic rewards and creativity via creative process engagement. Additionally, two types of employee characteristics, i.e. person-job fit and cognitive flexibility, are important contingency factors affecting the reward-creativity relationship. Our empirical analyses of data collected from 228 supervisor-subordinate dyads demonstrate the mediating role of creative process engagement in the reward-creativity relationship. Moreover, employees with high levels of person-job fit and cognitive flexibility are found to have the highest levels of creative process engagement and, in turn, the greatest creativity when motivated by extrinsic rewards for creativity. These findings have several theoretical and managerial implications related to reward-creativity research and practice.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2262373;Negative impression management: the troublemaker as trouble seeker. Extending the discourse on impression management, we explore a counter-intuitive workplace deviance phenomenon whereby employees aim to get themselves fired from their jobs. Employing exploratory qualitative methods, we collected evidence from employees who practice deliberate negative impression management (NIM), from parties who witnessed NIM, and from Human Resource (HR) managers who have dealt with NIM, in two distinct geographies: Israel and Taiwan. The paper outlines the diverse sources of NIM, its specified and unspecified aims, its actual consequences, and its prevalence. This unique dataset offers insights that extend our understanding of impression management theory and practice, serving as a mean to explicating a variant of deviant behavior at the workplace and providing information to HR personnel on ways to engage with the issue.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2254211;Being accepted there makes me rely less on acceptance here': cross-context identity enactment and coping with gender identity threats at work for non-binary individuals. We aimed to understand how nonbinary individuals cope with gender identity threats in different contexts at work. We used a grounded theory approach through semi-structured interviews with 28 nonbinary Brazilian individuals from 25 organizations. In environments that are threatening to their gender identity, nonbinary individuals adopt a trial-and-error process of gender identity expression that makes them realize that restructuring their identity leads to a high sense of inauthenticity, while preserving it incurs high social costs. As both are unsatisfactory, some of them adopt ambiguous responses that allow them to find ways to make identity claims through performative processes of gender identity expression. Such a process, although not fully reflecting their desire for authenticity, provides satisfactory validation. This mechanism is possible when they interact in other environments where their identity claims are validated. Thus, the gender identity expression validated in more receptive contexts allows these individuals to experience what we named as cross-context identity enactment. It is a process by which the social validation that individuals obtain by enacting an identity in a less-threatening context allows them to rely less on validation in a more threatening context to retain such identity in their self-concept.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2237876;The effects of workplace violence on the job stress of health care workers: buffering effects of wellbeing HRM practices. Contemporary research has focused on antecedents, incidences, and consequences of workplace violence in the healthcare sector. However, little is known about the role of HRM in supporting healthcare workers to cope with negative emotions arising from workplace violence. Grounded in the conservation of resources theory, this study examines the moderating effects of wellbeing HRM practices (WBHRM) on the relationship between workplace violence and job stress. We also examine the mediation effects of job stress on the relationship between workplace violence and quality of care. Data were gathered from 254 and 225 (Study 1) aged care workers (nurses and personal care assistants) in Australia and 136 healthcare workers (doctors and nurses) in China (Study 2) across multiple waves. We use a new measure of WBHRM in this paper to test our hypotheses. Results show that the presence of WBHRM practices moderated the relationship between workplace violence and job stress. We also found that job stress mediates the relationship between workplace violence and quality of care. The findings contribute to the HRM literature by providing an innovative WBHRM approach to support health care workers to cope with job stress after they experience workplace violence.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2169076;Antecedents and consequences of host nationals' attitudes towards hybrid language in MNCs: the case of MNC-tone. Multiple language use in multinational corporations (MNCs) crossing linguistic boundaries can lead to code-switching and the creation of hybrid languages. Hybrid languages in MNCs can facilitate or impede organizational processes. The source of such ambiguous findings may lie in individuals' attitudes toward hybrid languages. The sociolinguistics literature suggests that language attitudes impact individuals' in- and out-group behavior and may explain mixed findings of hybrid language use. We conduct research in the context of MNC-tone-a hybrid English-Chinese language popular in MNCs in China, which has also spilled into Chinese society among non-MNC workers. We examine the attitudes of Chinese nationals toward MNC-tone, the geo-social antecedents that contribute to attitude formation, and the consequences of such attitudes on perceived organizational attractiveness and interpersonal guanxi (informal and positive relationship between individuals facilitating processes in organizations). With survey data collected from Chinese employees in two interconnected studies (N = 342 and 502), we find that individuals from a multilingual landscape with access to foreign media and a multilingual social network have positive attitudes toward the hybrid language. Individuals with positive attitudes are likely to be attracted to work in MNCs that use the language and exercise interpersonal guanxi with others that use the hybrid language.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2126946;Middle-managers' innovative behavior: the roles of psychological empowerment and personal initiative. Middle-managers are vital catalysts for organizational innovation, acting as a bridge between organizational strategy and goals set by senior-managers and the actions of lower-level employees. Their proactive motivation to engage in innovative work behavior is therefore central to organizational endeavor. However, the innovation literature is replete with studies focusing solely on organizational-level determinants of middle-managers' innovative behavior while the HRM literature focuses predominantly on the experiences of lower-level employees. Little is known about the psychological factors and processes which give rise to middle-managers innovative work behavior. Drawing on the proactive motivation model, this study examines whether middle-managers' personal initiative mediates the relationship between the four dimensions of their psychological empowerment and their innovative work behaviors. Drawing on a sample of 110 middle-manager-supervisor dyads, our study highlights personal initiative as the mechanism through which psychological empowerment influences innovative work behaviors. Our work further informs the HR literature about how HR practices and systems may be used to foster middle manager proactivity in the workplace. In total, our study seeks to take a step towards reducing the dearth in knowledge on the psychological determinants of middle-managers' innovative work behaviors.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2078990;Employee psychological conditions as mediators of the relationship between human resource management and employee work engagement. Employee work engagement is an asset valued by today's organisations, not only as an indicator of well-being at work but also because it improves both employees' work performance and organisational performance. Knowing how employee work engagement can be fostered in the firm is therefore a subject of great interest to both academics and managers, but few studies have examined how organisational interventions positively affect employee work engagement. In this research, we focus on the relevance of organisations' human resource management to promote high levels of engagement among their employees. The theoretical framework guiding our research, Kahn's (1990) model, provides interesting insights into the mechanisms through which human resource management influences employee work engagement. By testing a multilevel model based on matched data from a sample of 146 HR managers and 504 employees in Spanish companies, our analyses show that high performance work systems have a positive influence on work engagement through the employee psychological conditions of meaningfulness, psychological safety and psychological availability.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.2005659;Host country national quality of interaction with expatriates: antecedents, process, and outcome. Little research examines host country national (HCN)-expatriate interaction from the HCN's perspective. Our study contributes to theory and practice by introducing the concept of 'HCN-expatriate interaction quality', one that has received little attention in the literature. Drawing on the Intergroup Contact Theory, we examine the mediating role of HCN-expatriate interaction quality between the HCN's on-the-job interaction with and support to the expatriate, as well as two moderating effects: off-the-job interaction with the expatriate and perceived expatriate receptivity towards support. Further, we examine how different types of the HCN's prior international experiences enhance interaction quality with and support to the expatriate. Using a multi-wave design of HCNs in Taiwan, we find support for most of our hypotheses.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1966491;Motivational cultural intelligence and expatriate talent adjustment: an exploratory study of the moderation effects of cultural distance. The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between motivational cultural intelligence and cultural adjustment of expatriate talent through the lens of cultural distance. The rapid development of MNCs from emerging markets and the corresponding increase in the need for expatriates makes it imperative that scholars examine this subject from numerous critical angles. Drawing on data from 242 Chinese expatriates based in 25 different countries/regions, we employ multilevel analyses to test the research hypotheses related to expatriate talent management. The results of this exploratory study confirm that motivational cultural intelligence has a positive and significant effect on cultural adjustment: work adjustment, general adjustment and interaction adjustment respectively, and cultural distance has a negatively moderating role between motivational cultural intelligence and work adjustment of expatriate talent. This paper helps to expand our understanding of the field of global talent management and the importance of motivational cultural intelligence and cultural distance on expatriate talent.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1954682;What do we have faith in? - a comparative study on trust and performance appraisal practices in French and German MNE-subsidiaries. We explore how subsidiaries in a high-trust (Germany) and low-trust (France) country adopt the performance appraisal (PA) system from their US-headquarter. In-depth interviews with 30 informants illustrate trickle-down effects of trust from the national level to the organizational and individual levels shaping processes, outputs, and interactions of PA. While German informants expressed trust in the overall PA practice of the US-headquarter, French informants reacted with mistrust to PA manifested in different processes, rater and ratee attitudes, outcomes of PA, as well as the role of HR. We add to the comparative HRM literature by untangling, within an MNE context, the interaction of societal, organizational, and individual trust with the overall PA to provide a more holistic explanation for cross-national variations in PA beyond the mere assignment to separate cultural categories.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1948890;HRM's financial value from obtaining more star performers. We assessed the financial value of human resource management (HRM) as a function of obtaining more star performers. Specifically, we implemented utility analysis procedures on 206 samples of individual performance (i.e. output) encompassing 824,924 workers. We found that HRM adds greater financial value by obtaining more stars. Our results also offer several specific contributions to HRM theory. First, regarding how HRM produces greater value by obtaining more stars, our evidence points to a nonlinear model of HRM's value, where HRM generates significant yet diminishing returns by increasingly obtaining the most productive ones. Second, regarding when, our results show that diminishing returns from HRM are stronger when output differences among top stars are relatively small. Third, regarding why, our study explains that small output differences among top stars may create various costs which diminish the returns from obtaining the most productive stars. Our explanation of HRM's nonlinear pattern contributes to the star literature by helping integrate a variety of specific explanations for stars' curvilinear influence discussed in past research. Regarding HRM practices, we highlight the need to use utility analysis procedures that more fully consider the existence of stars. Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/09585192.2021.1948890 .;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1931938;The impact of green HRM on green creativity: mediating role of pro-environmental behaviors and moderating role of ethical leadership style. In the aftermath of global warming, organizations are coming under increasing pressure to reduce carbon emissions, minimize waste, and generally become more responsible in their practices. To this backdrop, researchers argue that organizational HR practices have significant potential in shaping human behaviors. Therefore, by investigating the employment of a subordinate-supervisor dyad (N = 378 (subordinates), and 141 (supervisors)), this empirical study contributes to the growing literature on Green Human Resource Management (green HRM) and its impacts on employees' green outcomes. In particular, this study tested a novel model to explore the impact of green HRM on Green Creativity (GC) of employees in mediating the role of Pro-Environmental Behaviors (PEBs) and moderating the role of Ethical Leadership Style (ELS). Data were collected from organizations in the Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) region of Pakistan. For testing the results of the proposed hypotheses, structural equation modelling technique using SMART PLS 3 was employed. The results indicate that green HRM has a positive impact on employees' GC. Furthermore, partial mediating role of PEBs was also found. Finally, it was found that the ELS moderates the relationship between green HRM and GC and between green HRM and PEBs. Several theoretical and practical implications are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1913623;Exploring the adoption of virtual work: the role of virtual work self-efficacy and virtual work climate. Previous research has shown that virtual work provides benefits to individual employees (e.g. less stress, higher job satisfaction, and higher productivity), the organization (e.g. lower real estate costs and higher commitment and performance) and, potentially, society at large (less traffic, less pollution, and lower healthcare costs through reduced stress and work-family conflict). To realize the potential benefits associated with virtual work, many organizations have introduced new policies to enable employees to work virtually. However, research evidence and media reports indicate that many employees are hesitant to utilize the opportunity to work virtually. To better understand this gap between formal organizational policies and actual adoption, we investigate the predictors and conditions of virtual work adoption. Drawing on Lewin's field theory and Bandura's social cognitive theory, we examine the extent to which virtual work self-efficacy, virtual work climate, and their interaction predict individual adoption of virtual work arrangements. To test our hypotheses, we conducted a survey study of 256 employees from a multinational information technology company. Our results suggest that an effective virtual work climate encourages employees with low virtual work self-efficacy to engage in more virtual work.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2018.1512513;Oceans apart: work-life boundaries and the effects of an oversupply of segmentation. Employment trends see work and personal life domains becoming both more integrated (e.g. flexible working) and more segmented (e.g. global careers). Trends toward more extreme segmentation or integration may lead to a greater risk of misfit between employee preferences for and organizational supplies of integration/segmentation. This paper investigates the impact of organizational fit and misfit within a highly segmented occupational context: offshore work. With lengthy rotations away from home, followed by long periods away from work, limited inter-role communications and reduced day-to-day transitions between work and non-work roles, offshore work offers a segmented work-life interface. Fit and misfit of integration-segmentation preferences with perceptions of organizational integration-segmentation supply were examined among offshore employees, as well as their counterparts working traditional, office-based schedules. Using polynomial regression and response surface analysis, the impact of fit and misfit on work-life conflict, enrichment and organizational commitment was assessed. The data show that misfit resulting from an oversupply of segmentation may result in behavioral work-to-life conflict, associated with the reduced number of transitions between work and home roles, strain-based conflict, and a reduced transfer of resources from work to home resulting in less developmental work-life enrichment and organizational commitment. These findings contribute to existing literature by identifying the impact of misfit resulting from segmentation oversupply on individual and organizational outcomes, emphasizing the need for HR practitioners to recognize the potential for and impact of different forms of misfit within the changing landscape of their own organizational environments.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1080/09585192.2024.2331585;Linking top management's HR focus to innovation: the role of ownership structures and high-performance work systems. Unraveling the intricate ties between top management, human resource management, and firm innovation is crucial in today's dynamic business landscape. The role of firm ownership is particularly vital in understanding these processes, especially within the context of increasingly diverse ownership structures. This study leverages the signaling theory and the upper echelon theory to investigate the direct and indirect impacts of top management (TM)'s strategic human resource focus (SHF) on firm innovation and improvement (FII). We investigate the moderating effect of firm ownership structures (state-owned enterprises and privately-owned enterprises) and the mediating effect of a high-performance work system (HPWS) in these processes. Findings reveal that TM's SHF has both a positive direct effect and a positive indirect effect on FII through the implementation of HPWS. The study affirms the moderating influence of firm ownership on the relationship between TM's SHF and HPWS, as well as on the mediating effect of HPWS in the relationship between TM's SHF and FII. Our analysis also uncovers distinct patterns in how firm ownership moderates the direct and indirect effects of TM's SHF on FII. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2250257;Negotiating the volunteer role: a qualitative study of older volunteers' experiences in woodland conservation. This paper explores the exchange relationship between older conservation volunteers (aged over 50 years) and paid group organisers. Using qualitative interview data from seventeen adult volunteers and four organisers recruited from three conservation groups in the North West of England we argue that the psychological contract is important for understanding how organisations can manage and retain volunteers. Our findings highlight the importance of the psychological contract between volunteers and the group organiser, with each party recognising the mutual benefits they bring to the relationship. Participants' accounts revealed that they chose to take on the often physically challenging conservation work because the natural environment was important to them, but also because there was no obligation for them to attend. Thus, being a conservation volunteer allowed them to retain control over their voluntary time commitment and avoid the pressures of responsibility associated with having people depending upon them. At the micro-level, organisers appreciated the expectations and abilities of individual volunteers, managing and adjusting their own practices accordingly to encourage volunteer retention. We consider the implications of our research in terms of both volunteer and psychological contract theory and discuss the potential implications for organisations in terms of managing and retaining older volunteers.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2237865;'Everyone should have a wife' - extreme work, eldercare, and the gendered academy in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This research explores the micro-level experiences of women with eldercare responsibilities in academia. We present academia as a site of extreme work and a gendered space. The 'ideal academic' is predicated on neoliberal logic, where long hours, uninterrupted career paths, and being care-less in terms of responsibilities are rewarded. Our study is set within the Irish Higher Education (HEI) sector where we undertook in-depth interviews with female academics who have eldercare responsibilities. Our findings reveal eldercare as an 'invisible' form of care, while research, arguably a substantive performance metric in academia was also experienced as an invisible pursuit taking place outside normal working hours. The interplay between these two invisible forces had disastrous consequences for women during the pandemic, as they attempted to respond to the intensification of elder care needs while extreme work in academia became normalised and research metrics continued to be a key measure of excellence, regardless of context. Our findings highlight the need to reshape the identity of the 'ideal academic' and dismantle the link between intense work patterns and success. Equally, the recalibration of HR policies, and performance metrics, to support staff with care responsibility emerged as vital in ensuring a sustainable academic workforce.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2189022;Cue consistency matters: how and when newcomers respond to supervisor creativity expectations. Organizations may hire newcomers as a source of creativity, bringing fresh ideas and novel solutions to benefit organizational performance. However, the conditions that foster newcomer innovation are not well understood. Drawing on behavioral plasticity and cue consistency theories, we investigate the combined influence of new job self-efficacy and two work design factors (work autonomy and work demands) affecting how supervisor creativity expectations (SCEs) translate into newcomers behaving innovatively. Two-wave data were collected from 108 graduates of a university in China. Results using reliability-corrected single indicator latent moderated structural equation modeling (RCSLMS) supported our hypotheses. Thus, SCEs predicted newcomer innovative behavior more strongly for newcomers with low new job self-efficacy. Moreover, supporting cue consistency theory, newcomers who perceived high SCEs and low new job self-efficacy demonstrated the highest level of innovative behavior when work autonomy was high or work demands were low. These results broaden the application of behavioral plasticity theory for understanding newcomer behaviors. Further, our findings emphasize the importance of consistent work environment cues to encourage newcomer innovation.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2077127;Supporting Australian veteran transition: career construction through a person-environment fit perspective. Despite military veterans being recognised as a rich talent pool for employers, evidence suggests that their capabilities are not fully utilised in civilian workplaces, with recent research indicating difficulty finding appropriate jobs and high turnover rates for this population. This study is underpinned by a person-environment fit perspective, and applies career construction theory to explore veterans' perspectives of key challenges in their significant career transition from military service into the civilian workforce. It identifies ways for HRM professionals to improve integration and ultimately, retention. Interviews were conducted with 31 veterans from the Australian Defence Force who had transitioned from full-time service and had been working in civilian employment for at least six months but no more than three years. The research resulted in the development of a framework for veteran career transition that acknowledges the personal adaptation that occurs throughout this process and informs HR action required to attract and retain this valuable talent segment.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2063065;Employer branding orientation: effects on recruitment performance under COVID-19. In this study we examined the impact of employer branding orientation (EBO) on recruitment performance. The study is based on a sample of 153 knowledge-intensive firms operating on the Russian labor market. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to test the research model. Our results revealed that EBO positively related to employer branding strategy and employer value proposition (EVP) which, in turn, impact the recruitment performance. We also identified the moderating effect of COVID-19 influence on employer branding programs. This study contributes to the debate on the role of EBO in HRM practices of companies and provides practitioners with evidence on importance of EVP formulation.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2043925;The role of robotization in work design: a comparative case study among logistic warehouses. Robots are increasingly used in a variety of work environments, but surprisingly little attention has been paid to how robots change work. In this comparative case study, we explore how robotization changed the work design of order pickers and order packers in eight logistic warehouses. We found that all warehouses robotized tasks based on technological functionality to increase efficiency, which sometimes created jobs consisting of 'left-over tasks'. Only two warehouses used a bottom-up approach, where employees were involved in the implementation and quality of work was considered important. Although the other warehouses did not, sometimes their work design still benefitted from robotization. The positive effects we identified are reduced physical and cognitive demands and opportunities for upskilling. Warehouses that lack attention to the quality of work may risk ending up with the negative effects for employees, such as simplification and intensification of work, and reduced autonomy. We propose that understanding the consequences of robots on work design supports HR professionals to help managing this transition by both giving relevant input on a strategic level about the importance of work design and advocating for employees and their involvement.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.2016888;Sourcing human capital for organizational effectiveness: sourcing strategy, determinants, and alignment. Human capital sourcing is a major determinant of firm effectiveness. We develop logic that favors a specialized sourcing strategy in which organizations emphasize one type of sourcing, focusing either on developing or acquiring human capital, as opposed to a balanced approach. We then identify characteristics and capabilities that lead firms to adopt one sourcing type over another. Additionally, we examine whether aligning sourcing decisions with organizational characteristics and capabilities relates to better performance. We use panel regression to examine how sourcing decisions ultimately impact performance. Results suggest that specialized sourcing relates to improved performance more strongly than does a balanced approach, that certain organizational capabilities are advantageous for specific types of sourcing, and that aligning sourcing strategy with organizational fit partially relates to greater organizational performance.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1991977;Sensemaking and spirituality: the process of re-centring self-decentralisation at work. This study explores sensemaking as grounded in identity construction in the context of workplace spirituality to uncover how individuals make sense of the process of self-decentralisation. The paper adopts the Buddhist notion of non-self as an analytical tool to explore how Buddhist practitioners in organisational contexts 'empty out' and de-centre the self in constructing and negotiating self-identity in the workplace. Through 104 interviews with both executives and employees who are Buddhist practitioners, the study reveals a phenomenon of re-centring self-decentralisation emerging in the pursuit of self-decentralisation. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how individuals make sense of work in the context of a spiritual practice and highlight practical implications for HRM practices to manage dynamic interpretations and enactments of spiritual practices in organisations.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1958247;Predictors of employees' strike attitudes in multinational corporations in China: a multilevel relational model. China experienced an unprecedented increase in labor strikes until the mid-2010s, and the country continues to experience considerable strike activity. Therefore, it is important to study what predicts Chinese workers' attitudes toward strikes. The study applies social exchange theory as an overarching framework to investigate the contributions of three forms of social exchange relations in organizations-employee-employer relations, labor-management relations, and leader-member relations-to account for Chinese employees' attitudes toward strikes in multinational corporations (MNCs) based in China. Using a matched employee-employer sample of more than 1,600 employees in 41 China-based MNCs, the results obtained from hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analysis show that individual-perceived employee-employer relations indicated by a negative reciprocity norm is positively related to employees' strike attitudes. Labor-management relations indicated by the organizational-level cooperative industrial relations (IR) climate is negatively related to employees' strike attitudes. Leader-member relations indicated by leader-member exchange (LMX) is not significantly related to employees' strike attitudes. Overall, the results indicate that at the individual level, it is more important for companies not to do bad (to engage in negative reciprocity with workers) than to do good to reduce employees' strike attitudes.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1962388;Psychological entitlement and organizational citizenship behaviors: the roles of employee involvement climate and affective organizational commitment. The present study develops and tests an overreaching theoretical framework based on social exchange theory to examine the situations under which individuals with high levels of psychological entitlement are more or less likely to exhibit positive work attitudes and behaviors. In particular, we integrate perspectives from the team climate literature to analyze the moderating effects of employee involvement climate at the workgroup level on the relationship between psychological entitlement and organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) through the mediating mechanism of affective commitment (a first-stage moderated mediation model). To test our hypotheses, we collected data from 231 supervisor-subordinate dyads across 41 work teams at a large Chinese automobile manufacturer. We find that when the employee involvement climate level is high, the effects of psychological entitlement on OCBs through affective commitment are positive and significant. In contrast, when the employee involvement climate level is low, the relationship is negative and significant. The present study makes a theoretical contribution to the literature by examining the frequently neglected positive side of psychological entitlement. It demonstrates that a high employee involvement climate helps to engage psychologically entitled employees by circumventing previously unbalanced social exchange relationships. We also discuss the practical implications of our findings and provide suggestions for human resource managers to maximize the contributions of entitled employees and foster their organizational commitment and OCBs.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1956564;The relationship between HIWPs and nurse work engagement: the role of job crafting and supervisor support. The purpose of this paper is to provide a mediation explanation of the relationship between HRM and nurse work engagement. The study contributes to understanding how high involvement work practices (HIWPs) relate to nurse work engagement by analysing the mediating role played by job crafting. The study also considers the importance of supervisor support as a moderator in the mediated relationship. The study was based on an anonymous online survey of 2,984 nurses employed in Australia. Analysis confirms the hypothesised relationships in that job crafting was found to mediate the positive relationship between HIWPs and work engagement. Further, supervisor support moderated the indirect relationship between HIWPs and work engagement through job crafting, such that the indirect effect was stronger under increasing levels of supervisor support. The results have implications for the importance of HIWPs on job crafting for nurses who carry out many professional roles simultaneously. Furthermore, the research highlights the role that supervisors play in encouraging and managing nurses who take advantage of HIWP opportunities to shape, mould and redefine their jobs.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2019.1579749;Employment integration barriers: experiences of people with disabilities. People with disabilities experience barriers in the integration phase of employment. The aim of this article was to examine the experiences of people with disabilities relating to job application forms and advertisements, interviews, confidentiality and disclosure of disability, as well as medical and psychometric testing. Qualitative data on the barriers experienced were obtained from semi-structured interviews with 72 people with differing disabilities in South Africa. Findings showed that despite progressive legislation, people with disabilities experience barriers in the integration phase of employment. To prevent barriers to employment, advertisements, application forms, interview venues and interview questions need to be accessible and appropriate for people with disabilities. In addition, the selection criteria and medical and psychometric testing used need to be appropriate and non-discriminatory. Insights from this qualitative article can assist in preventing employment integration barriers. This in turn will have an influence on human resource managers' hiring of people with disabilities, employers' meeting their employment equity targets, being viewed as an employer of choice who values diversity and having productive employees and a low staff turnover.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2018.1479876;Flexible work practices and organizational attractiveness in Germany: The mediating role of anticipated organizational support. This study analyzes how flexible work practices (FWPs) such as flexible work schedules, telecommuting, and sabbaticals affect the organizational attractiveness of companies to job seekers in the German job market. We apply conservation of resource theory to propose that FWPs are positively related to perceived organizational attractiveness. Furthermore, we use organizational support theory to suggest that this link is mediated by job seekers' anticipated organizational support. We test our predictions using two complementary studies among German job seekers: A field study (N = 188) at two job fairs and an online scenario experiment (N = 469). Our findings indicate that flexible work practices, in particular flexible work schedules and sabbaticals, significantly increase organizational attractiveness as perceived by job seekers and that these effects are indeed mediated by anticipated organizational support. Our results further suggest that this link is independent of job seekers' attitudes towards FWPs and that the effect of sabbaticals is stronger than the effect of either flexible work schedules or telecommuting.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2020.1871399;The soft skills gap: a bottleneck in the talent supply in emerging economies. The purpose of this study is to identify the soft skills, relevant to the future talent pool in the information technology (IT) sector. Further, the study aims to investigate soft skills gaps among students which are hampering the availability of talent. Soft skills traits were first identified through a literature review. Then, using a structured questionnaire, we surveyed 269 IT professionals working in five IT companies and 329 students pursuing degrees in the IT/CS from 12 technical institutes. The analysis was performed using principal component analysis and an independent t test. We examined important soft skills such as personal traits, leadership, interpersonal skills, team skills, enterprising skills, and organizational skills. The independent t test results showed a perception gap between professionals and students regarding the importance of soft skills. This study contributes to the literature by adding to the understanding of critical soft skills in IT sector. It underlines the partnership between educational institutions and the IT industry to address this gap. This partnership will benefit all stakeholders. We argue that although talent management is dealt with at the industry level, academia play an important role in making this process easier and effective by developing the desired skills in students.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2382480;The impact of environmental strategy on environmental performance: mediating role of green human resource management and moderating role of green consciousness of top managers. The significant influence of green human resource management (GHRM) on a firm's environmental performance (EP) has garnered considerable attention in recent literature. Research on GHRM has primarily focused on its impact on employee green behavior or outputs, neglecting its role as an organizational-level resource in facilitating the implementation of environmental strategy (ES). Additionally, limited attention has been paid to the influence of green consciousness (GC) of top managers on this process. Drawing on the resource-based view and upper echelons theory, this study employed a moderated mediation model to explore the relationships among ES, GHRM and GC of top managers. Data were collected from questionnaire responses of 476 senior executives from Chinese warehousing or logistics firms, gathered in three phases using a time-lagged approach. Results indicated that GHRM partially mediates the relationship between ES and EP. Additionally, it was found that GC of top managers moderates the relationship between ES and GHRM, acting as a boundary condition for the mediating effect of GHRM on EP. The study concludes with a discussion of several theoretical and practical implications arising from these findings.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This study is motivated by the infancy of literature on strategic HRM in regard to government policies and the lack of empirical research on the HRM policy of nationalization in the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). As such, it adopts a process oriented strategic HRM perspective through developing and examining an integrative framework of the antecedents and outcomes of the quality of the implementation of the Qatarized workforce in Qatar. This framework is informed by three aspects of the strategic planning process, namely, formulation, implementation, and evaluation, as determinants of the quality of implementation of the Qatarization strategy and how the latter, along with the three sets of strategic planning variables, influence the success of this strategy. In surveying 313 managers from organizations in Qatar, the study contributes to several streams of the literature: strategic HRM, nationalization, and strategic management, where the findings show that the implementation quality of Qatarization strategy is shaped by all three as aspects of the strategic planning process and that the success of this strategy cannot adequately be targeted without such an integrative perspective. However, the findings also suggest that the three aspects do not contribute equally to the success of this strategy. These findings entail several implications for managers, including the importance of paying heed to the comprehensive concept of integrative strategic planning in general, and the important role that formal planning plays when ensuring the success of publicly mandated HRM strategies.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This study investigates how global talent management (GTM) contributes to host-country national (HCN) knowledge sharing. Drawing from the social exchange, social identity, and attribution theories, we developed a theoretical model to examine how GTM influences HCN knowledge sharing via increased organizational identification and the moderating role of GTM climate strength in foreign subsidiaries. The survey results from 744 HCNs working for 28 foreign subsidiaries in South Korea demonstrate that HCNs' perceived GTM enhances their knowledge sharing by increasing organizational identification. A cross-level interaction analysis further suggests that GTM climate strength facilitates a positive relationship between GTM perceptions and HCN knowledge sharing, emphasizing the effect of consistency between the perceived GTM of employees and that of employers.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1080/09585192.2022.2104128;An exploration of contextual factors affecting the nexus of competitive strategy and human resource management practices in Nigeria emerging economy context. Despite increasing calls for context-specific and practice-based strategic human resource management research in emerging economies, to date there have been limited empirical studies on Nigeria, one of Africa's largest economies and a newly emerging economy experiencing strong economic development, rapid industrialisation, and integration into global markets. This study explores the moderating influence of contextual factors on the nexus of competitive strategy (CS) and human resource management practices (HRMPs) in Nigeria. We employ the social and comparative institutional theories to address the moderating influence of the contextual factors on the CS-HRMP nexus using a qualitative research approach. Data were collected from thirty human resource management professionals and top management across medium-sized enterprises in Nigeria via semi-structured interviews. The resulting data were analysed through thematic analysis. We establish six main contextual factors-culture and value system, religion, ethnicity and linguistic affinity, economic factors, politics and governmental policies, and quality of education and low-skilled workforce-and the processes through which these factors influence the CS-HRMP nexus in Nigeria.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2070715;Job satisfaction and public service motivation in Australian nurses: the effects of abusive supervision and workplace bullying. Workplace mistreatment is common in healthcare, especially among nurses, who may experience mistreatment from different sources, yet must carry out essential, public-facing duties. However, researchers have typically studied forms of mistreatment in isolation. This paper investigates the combined relationship between abusive supervision (i.e., vertical mistreatment) and workplace bullying (i.e., horizontal mistreatment) on job satisfaction and public service motivation among nurses. Drawing from self-determination theory, we examine how experiencing workplace mistreatment can thwart the fulfilment of psychological needs, operationalised as job satisfaction. Experiencing workplace bullying alongside abusive supervision is predicted to worsen this relationship. In turn, nurses are less likely to internalise their organisation's values, leading to less public service motivation. We tested our hypotheses on 219 Australian public sector nurses via an online survey, with a temporal separation of six weeks. Results suggest that abusive supervision has an indirect negative association with public service motivation, via job satisfaction. Workplace bullying moderated the indirect relationship at high and low levels, though the indirect relationship was stronger at low levels. Our study contributes to a well-rounded understanding of workplace mistreatment, particularly within the context of self-determination theory, and to our understanding of how public service motivation is affected by employees' social environment.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.2005658;High-performance work practices and labour productivity: a six wave longitudinal study of UK manufacturing and service SMEs. This study utilises both evolutionary resource-based view (EBRV) and open systems theory to investigate the long term impact of high-performance work practices (HPWPs) on labour productivity in UK manufacturing and service sector SMEs. We investigate both forward and reverse causality and the moderating role of owner-manager strategic orientation, and whether such relationships are influenced by firm size and age. Utilising a longitudinal data set (a balanced panel) comprising 284 UK SMEs and six waves of data collection over a ten-year time period (2007-2017), we found support for both forward and reverse causality. Prior investments in HPWPs were positively associated with subsequent firm labour productivity and prior labour productivity was positively associated with future investment in HPWPs. The size of the estimated coefficients for these relationships were consistently larger for small firms than for medium sized firms, however there were not significant for firm age. We additionally found that owner-manager strategic orientation towards HR moderated both forward and reverse causality relationships and that this relationship increased over time. The size of the estimated coefficients was larger in small firms compared to medium-sized firms. Overall, our findings support calls to investigate both forward and reverse causality and to better understand potential differences between small and medium sized firms.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.2001764;Talent management in the public sector: empirical evidence from the Emerging Economy of Dubai. Talent Management (TM) has attracted considerable attention across the globe and the challenges of managing talent effectively and delivering on strategic agendas is increasingly recognized. Yet TM has remained underexplored in emerging markets, particularly, in the public sector context. This research aims to fill the gap by exploring TM in the public sector of the emerging economy of Dubai. 34 in-depth interviews with senior human resource (HR) managers, field visits and extensive document reviews provide insights about TM practices and policies in the public sector. Our key findings indicate that TM in the public sector in Dubai is ineffective, and fragmented. Accordingly, we offer some potentially valuable implications for theory, practice, and future research.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We identify and explore the consequences of present uncertainties of a broad scale and scope for the practice of HRM. We then review salient bodies of theorising, and map out relevant areas of application. This is followed by a presentation of some of the most recent work on uncertainty and HRM that is encompassed in this collection, which brings to bear evidence from around the world.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1960584;The role of context in overcoming distance-related problems in global virtual teams: an organizational discontinuity theory perspective. Working at a distance has become a hot topic since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. One type of work unit that naturally faces both physical and social distance is the Global Virtual Teams (GVT). While distance has been debated in the GVT literature, there is still a scarcity of research on how to deal with distance related problems. Guided by organizational discontinuity theory, we explore the effect of individual-level approaches to overcoming physical distance (time zone adjustment) and social distance (trust in peers) in GVTs. In addition, we assess how these mechanisms are affected by the team context in the form of openness to cultural diversity. We do this by studying 23 GVTs (171 team members and 23 team leaders) in the global R&D department of a Danish engineering company. Our findings demonstrate that trust in peers is positively associated with job role clarity and job performance at the individual-level, and that high team openness to diversity, in the case of performance, makes the individual's level of trust in peers less necessary for achieving performance. Our results also show that time zone adjustment increases job role clarity for the individual team member, but only in GVTs with high openness to cultural diversity. Based on this, we contribute to the organizational discontinuity theory by demonstrating how continuity-creating mechanisms can interact with the team context to ultimately support the individual's potential for handling distance in GVTs.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1080/09585192.2019.1602549;Working to help or helping to work? Work-overload and allocentrism as predictors of organizational citizenship behaviours. We tested the prediction that work-overload has differing relationships with organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB) depending on who primarily benefits from such behaviour and the extent to which individuals are allocentric. The study builds on the job demand control model and research suggesting that although work-overload and OCBs seem unrelated, the relationship likely depends on other factors. We conceptualise these factors to be those that pressure individuals to engage in OCB. Tenured faculty (n = 300) from Sri Lanka completed measures administered in their primary language. Results indicated greater work-overload is associated with lower OCBI but higher OCBO and that allocentrism moderates the overload-OCBI relationship. Implications to employee wellbeing and OCB conceptualizations are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MNEs' HRM practices need to be mindful of the institutional differences between the local context of host countries and that of their home countries. Balancing the localization of HRM practices with the desire for global standardization and integration is a dilemma for MNEs. We examine this tension utilizing a unique perspective, namely by analyzing the HRM challenges that MNEs face with regard to LGBT employees in Africa. We find that MNEs experience difficulty in reconciling their global corporate values and HR policies with local institutions and legislative requirements. Several contributions result. First, by bringing issues of duality to the fore both at the organizational and individual level. Second, we contribute towards the global configuration literature in international HRM as regards global standardization and national differentiation, by focusing on developing countries, where the scale of the cultural or institutional distance between home and host countries are likely to be larger, which allows us to examine the difficulties of the transfer of HR practices to these sites. Third, we embed our analysis of localization within institutional theory, and finally, we integrate these contributions into an analysis of HRM challenges of LGBT employees in hostile contexts and make recommendations.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1925323;Voice in context: An international comparative study of employee experience with voice in small and medium enterprises. The study of employee voice in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) across national contexts remains under-theorised and under-studied. This paper uses Kaufman's integrative model of employee voice, and an exploratory study of 30 interviews with employees in non-unionised SMEs in the United Kingdom, Thailand and Nigeria, to compare the employee experience with voice, and the impact of this experience on voice behaviour at work. Findings show that the interaction between the external institutional context and internal SME context (organisational configuration, governance structure and internal contingencies in the employment relationship) impacts employee voice agency, the perceived levels of voice and, ultimately, employee voice behaviour. The paper contributes to employee voice theory by offering an analysis of voice determinants on voice behaviour specific to non-unionised SMEs from an international comparative employee perspective, presents these in an initial framework and explains how employees experience voice in small workplaces.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2018.1511611;Intellectual capital and firm performance: the mediating role of innovation speed and quality. The purpose of this study is to explore the influence of intellectual capital (IC) on firm performance, considering the mediating role of innovation speed and quality. We develop a research model based on the IC perspective and innovation literature. We test the model by using structural equation modeling to analyze data collected from 328 high-technology firms in China. The results show that the three components of IC, namely human capital, structural capital, and relational capital, are positively related to innovation speed and quality, which in turn facilitate the operational and financial performance of a firm. The impacts of human and structural capital on financial performance are fully mediated by innovation speed and quality, whereas the impact of relational capital on financial performance is partially mediated. Innovation speed and quality partially mediate the effect of IC on operational performance. As one of the first studies to investigate how IC may influence firm performance through the mediating effects of innovation speed and quality, this study not only contributes to HRM literature on IC and innovation, but also offers managers with insights on how to align their HRM strategies and practices to develop IC when pursuing innovation and performance outcomes.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2018.1511617;Abusive supervision and subordinates' physical and mental health: the effects of job satisfaction and power distance orientation. We developed and tested a moderated mediation model of work and health-related outcomes of abusive supervision. Drawing on the stressor-strain framework and conservation of resources theory, we hypothesized that subordinates' job satisfaction has a negative mediating effect between abusive supervision and subordinates' physical health and mental health problems. Because stressor-strain linkages are subject to individual-level variations, we further hypothesized that subordinates' power distance orientation moderates the relation between abusive supervision and job satisfaction, such that this relation is attenuated as power distance orientation increases. We tested these hypotheses on data collected from 603 employees through three surveys over a 12-month period in Japan. The findings support our hypotheses and moderated mediation model.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2018.1496128;Talent management: managerial sense making in the wake of Omanization. We examine how managers in Oman make sense of localization policies (Omanization) through their use of talent management (TM). Through an institutional logics (IL) lens, it is possible to examine how organizations confront institutional complexity and understand the interplay between state, market and societal logics. The paper analyses twenty-six interviews with managers in the Petroleum and Banking sector and is the first to examine TM within the context of Omanization using a layered, IL perspective. The paper finds that punitive state logics encourage organizations to focus on the societal wellbeing of their TM measures and inspires a sense of corporate social responsibility. Yet, the market logic dictates a stratified and differentiated approach that manages impressions of inclusivity while safeguarding organizational interests.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1879205;Talent management in turbulent times: Selection, negotiation, and exploration strategies for talent management in the aeronautics and space industries. Talent Management (TM) is traditionally analyzed as a set of interrelated processes that firms use to develop their human capital in accordance with their needs. Turbulent environmental conditions are pushing TM to evolve in order to cope with change and uncertainty and is prompting talent managers to attempt to change the nature of TM. We investigate how talent managers are conducting this change through a framework based on social agency. We present exploratory research conducted on 20 companies in the aeronautics and space sectors, a set of industries facing turbulence. On the basis of 35 formal and 27 informal interviews, we outline three strategies being used by talent managers that are enabling TM to evolve: selection, negotiation, and exploration strategies. Our research reveals that TM is a flexible construct within companies facing turbulence, which gives TM a role as a method of planning and a vehicle for change.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

How are leaders influenced by their assumptions about human nature? From a social cognitive perspective, this study examines the effects of a leader's implicit followership theory (IFT) on the leader's integrity, engagement, and effectiveness as a mentor. Multisource data collected from a diverse sample of CEOs and senior executives of large organizations (N = 331) and their direct reports (N = 1,517) suggest that leaders who hold optimistic IFTs are more likely to be relationally engaged with their direct reports and are more likely to be rated higher on integrity and mentoring effectiveness. Together, these results advance an ethical stewardship and relational mentoring perspective on human resource management.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2421348;A double-edged sword: empowering leadership to employees' work-life interface. Given the strongly held consensus that empowering leadership is beneficial, leadership scholars have overstated its benefits and overlooked its costs. In response to increasing calls for investigation of empowering leadership's double-edged effects, we uncover the enabling and burdening effects of empowering leadership on employees' work-life interface by positioning job demands and work passion as important underlying mechanisms. Based on the Conservation of Resources (COR) theory, we contend that via serial mediating roles of learning demands and harmonious passion, empowering leadership may positively relate to employee work enhancement of personal life. Empowering leadership can also predict employee work interference with personal life via serial mediating roles of outcome responsibility and obsessive passion. Four-wave data based on the Indian managerial employees (n = 251) supported our serial mediation hypotheses. Our study provides researchers and practitioners with new insights into the mechanisms explaining the double-edged effects of empowering leadership on employees' work-life interface.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Hinged on the Resource Orchestration Theory (ROT), this study investigates the influence of human resource strategic roles and operational roles on green human resource management (green HRM) through the mediation of perceived environmental orientation. A self-administered questionnaire technique was used, and data were collected from 139 HR professionals from the hospitality industry in Pakistan.

10.1080/09585192.2024.2392830;A role perspective on flexible human resource practices and older workers' early retirement intentions. Although recent studies examined the factors influencing older workers' early retirement decisions, little is known about how age-related shifts in social roles from the work to family domains affect older workers' early retirement intentions. Guided by role theory, we propose that flexible human resource (HR) practices are negatively related to older workers' early retirement intentions via decreased role conflict (work-family and family-work conflict). Furthermore, we take a role identity perspective and argue that gender may work as a fundamental contingency factor influencing the relationship between role conflict (work-family and family-work conflict) and early retirement intentions. Data were collected from Chinese organizations with a matching sample of 228 older workers (aged 45 years and older) and HR managers from 48 organizations, and a multilevel path analysis was conducted to test the hypotheses. The results showed that flexible HR practices have a negative indirect relationship with early retirement intentions through decreased family-to-work conflict. The influence of family-to-work conflict on early retirement intentions is stronger for women than for men. We also found that the effect of work-to-family conflict on early retirement intentions is stronger than that of family-to-work conflict. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2285362;(Not) seeing eye to eye on developmental HRM practices: perceptual (in)congruence and employee outcomes. This paper focuses on perceptions of Developmental HRM Practices (DHRMP) and their relationship with employee outcomes. We extend the currently existing and predominant social exchange perspective with insights from uncertainty (reduction) theory, to examine vertical (between employee and supervisor) and horizontal (between employee and co-workers reporting to the same supervisor) (in)congruences in DHRMP perceptions, and their relationships with employees' affective organizational commitment (AOC), turnover intention and proactive behavior. Data from 369 employees in 46 teams, and multi-level polynomial regressions show that for vertical (in)congruence, AOC and turnover intention are most favorable when both the employee's and supervisor's perceptions are congruent and positive. This nuances previous research rooted in social exchange theory as it implies that positive employee perceptions of DHRMP, in isolation, are insufficient to maximize both outcomes. In contrast, we find the highest proactive behavior for employees perceiving positive DHRMP, irrespective of their supervisor's perceptions. Finally, for horizontal (in)congruence, AOC and proactive behavior are highest when the employee's perceptions are more positive than their co-workers', and suboptimal when both parties have similarly positive perceptions. This suggests that incongruence in DHRMP perceptions is not necessarily counterproductive.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2255824;Trapped in cisnormative and binarist gendered constraints at work? How HR managers react to and manage gender transitions over time. This article examines the ways transitioning employees perceive employing organizations' readiness and willingness to deal with gender transitions and identifies barriers to those employees being able to express their gender in the workplace in their preferred manner. We draw on interviews with 25 transitioning trans persons who, over a period of two years, were interviewed on four occasions and asked about the ways in which their gender transition was handled at work. It appears that societal cisnormative and binarist gender regimes are pervasive in HR practices, restricting the support for, and acceptance of, trans and non-binary employees' gender transitions in the workplace in several ways. Besides confirming the perceived lack of organizational knowledge about transgender issues in general, and gender transitions more specifically, the interviews reveal that in order to become intelligible for HR managers and colleagues, employee transgender status has to be both visible, and unambiguously attributable to either a male or female gender expression. Everything in-between, gender-non-conforming, non-binary, non-gendered, or mutable seems to be met with confusion and receives less acceptance and support. Furthermore, the results show the temporal and declining nature of support and understanding during a gender transition. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2157681;Linking high-performance work systems to affective commitment, job satisfaction, and career satisfaction: Thriving as a mediator and wasta as a moderator. This study examines how high-performance work systems (HPWSs) are related to Saudi employees' work and career outcomes. Drawing on the socially embedded model of thriving, we propose a model that includes the mediating role of thriving at work and the moderating role played by wasta in the relationship between HPWS and the employee outcomes of affective commitment, job satisfaction, and career satisfaction. To test the conceptual model, we collected data from 187 healthcare workers across Saudi Arabian hospitals at three time points. Our findings reveal that HPWSs positively affect employees' thriving at work, which in turn enhances their work and career outcomes. Our study also demonstrates that wasta is a boundary condition that buffers the strength of the effect of HPWSs on thriving and the indirect effects of HPWSs on employees' work and career outcomes via thriving. This study extends current theoretical knowledge of how and when HPWSs can exert a more positive influence on employee outcomes. In practice, these findings will inform managers of better approaches to leveraging HPWSs and individual cultural values to enhance employee outcomes.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We report a phenomenographic study that reveals philosophies elicited on talent management (TM) systems in a sample of Australian subsidiaries of foreign multinational enterprises. We label these philosophies as The Carrot, The Risk, The Caretaker, The Conversation and The Strength. Each philosophy portends a unique TM system, guided by an overarching tenet alongside operational principles across function, timeframe and stakeholder foci. We speculate that a set of internal and external contingencies, based on country- and firm-level contexts, influence philosophies on TM systems. Reporting these nuances and distinctions across philosophies, we contribute to a possible shift in the TM literature from non-contextualized, generalized TM models to explicit firm and country contextualized representations that convey the unique value and treatment of a firm's talent, as it is understood by practicing managers.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1964092;The value of mixed methods work-family research for human resource management: a review and agenda. Managing the work-family interface is increasingly strategic for international human resource management (HRM) in attracting and retaining a diverse workforce. Yet despite growing methodological sophistication in the field work-family research still lacks a truly global approach, one that considers alternative work and family conceptualisations, particularly those from the so-called Global South. This article addresses these shortcomings by proposing mixed methods research (MMR), rather than a single method (quantitative or quantitative only), to offer a dual analytical lens which can deepen and broaden our understanding of work-family issues in and across diverse and multinational contexts. We critically review the methodological features of 40 work-family studies that used MMR, revealing the need for stronger integration. Then, through a thematic analysis of the reviewed articles, we highlight three distinct ways in which MMR adds value to the field: grounding empirical work and theorising within context, improving appropriateness of measurement instruments, and enhancing validity of inferences for relevant HRM practices. We conclude with an agenda for future mixed methods work-family research and present implications for human resource managers and work-family scholars in an increasingly competitive and changing international employment milieu.

10.1080/09585192.2018.1521460;How do socialization tactics and supervisor behaviors influence newcomers' psychological contract formation? The mediating role of information acquisition. This study examines how an organization's socialization tactics and supervisor behaviors can influence a newcomer's psychological contract by identifying the specific factors involved in its formation process. It hypothesizes that socialization tactics and supervisor behaviors would help newcomers perceive more promises in their relationship with the organization and that this relationship would be mediated by the acquisition of organizational information. In this study, a longitudinal approach was adopted and 221 newcomers at major Korean companies were surveyed twice, with a three-month interval between the surveys. The results show that the extent to which socialization tactics are institutionalized positively affects newcomers' perception of promises. The extent to which supervisors demonstrate relational behaviors also positively affects newcomers' perceptions of promises. Further, these relationships are fully mediated by the acquisition of organizational information. The results show the significant impact of socialization tactics and supervisor behaviors on the formation of psychological contracts, highlighting the role of information as one of the causal explanations of these relationships.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Given the challenges of new ventures to attract applicants, this paper focuses on the influence of applicants' perceptions of entrepreneurs for new venture recruitment. Based on role congruity theory, we propose that organizational attractiveness increases when entrepreneurs show entrepreneurial leadership, which fits the new venture context, and that this effect is mediated by perceived authenticity. Moreover, we propose this effect is particularly pertinent when entrepreneurs are young and male and thus fit the prevailing demographic stereotype of entrepreneurs. In our experiment (n = 503), we found the positive effect of showing entrepreneurial leadership on organizational attractiveness via authenticity perceptions, and this effect was stronger if the entrepreneur was young - the entrepreneur's gender did not moderate the relationship. We discuss the implications of our study for research and practice in recruitment and entrepreneurship.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1879206;The adoption of artificial intelligence in employee recruitment: The influence of contextual factors. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been presented as a powerful tool in human resource management (HRM), but little academic research exists on the topic. The present study introduces the technology, organization, and environment (TOE) model from information systems research and integrates it with the transaction cost theory to better understand the facilitators and the constraints of companies' AI adoption behavior during employee recruitment. Survey results from 297 Chinese companies suggest that companies' perceived complexity toward AI constrains AI adoption, while technology competence and regulatory support encourage AI adoption. Relative advantages of AI technology, company size, and industry have no significant impact on AI usage. The findings also demonstrate the moderating effects of transaction costs on the influential power of technological complexity and organizations' technology competence.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2417177;War vs pandemic-investigating the type of extreme context as a moderator of extreme-context perception effects on work alienation and its organisational outcomes. With many organisations operating in challenging circumstances such as military conflicts and pandemics, a growing body of research has investigated the effects of extreme-context perceptions on job attitudes and organisational outcomes. While prior investigations focused on specific extreme contexts like warzones or pandemics, research has yet to examine whether different extreme contexts would have different intensities regarding shaping job attitudes and organisational outcomes. This study takes a unique approach to address this gap in the existing literature by exploring whether the type of extreme context (war vs pandemic) moderates extreme-context-perception effects on work alienation and subsequent job attitudes and organisational outcomes. Specifically, this study investigates the consequences of differentiated extreme contexts by using 668 valid responses from two samples: Sample 1 (N = 449), collected via snowball sampling during the Syrian civil war (2016-2019), and Sample 2 (N = 219), recruited using systematic random sampling from the Middle East during COVID-19 in 2021. Employing t-tests, Sample 1 in the wartime crisis reported higher levels of extreme-context perception, yet not quite as much worsened job satisfaction, but they had lower levels of alienation and job insecurity than those in health-crisis contexts. Using PLS-SEM, we found extreme-context perception heightened alienation, leading to increased job insecurity, decreased job satisfaction, and lower organisational citizenship behaviour (OCB) outcomes. Interestingly, some of these relationships were moderated by the extreme context type. Specifically, while no significant differences were found between the two contexts regarding the relationship between extreme context perception and alienation and between alienation and job insecurity, we found that extreme-context-driven alienation is more likely to damage job satisfaction and OCB in war zones than in pandemic contexts. These findings contribute to important matters of both theory and practice. They specifically expand existing theory by illustrating differentiated consequences of distinct types of extreme contexts to organisational and employee-related concerns. They also demonstrate the need to develop customised organisational strategies as well as policy responses to mitigate and/or capitalise on the effects of differentiated extreme contexts.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the current study, we contend that one way in which the management of people and work impacts organization performance is through building capabilities. More specifically, expanding beyond the traditional HR systems-organization performance research literature, we examine how HR flexibility, technical HRM, strategically-oriented HRM, and workforce strategic importance build a specific type of capabilities, namely organization strategic human capabilities, which in turn drives organization performance. Within a global, cross-industry sample composed of 9,923 individuals from 505 for-profit organizations, HR flexibility, strategically-oriented HRM, and workforce strategic importance were found to have positive effects on organization strategic human capabilities. Our findings also indicate that both technical and strategically-oriented HRM affect organization strategic human capabilities indirectly through HR flexibility. Furthermore, in addition to its positive effect on organization strategic human capabilities, workforce strategic importance was found to moderate HR flexibility's positive effect on organization strategic human capabilities. Finally, within a subsample composed of 8,060 individuals from 284 for-profit organizations, organization strategic human capabilities were found to be a key proximal precursor of organization performance.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2377221;How does the supervisor-subordinate relational schema shape employee voice behaviour in China?. Previous research has shown that the relationship between a supervisor and a subordinate is crucial in shaping employee voice behaviour. However, where these relationships originate needs to be clarified. Studies on relational schemas suggest that the quality of these relationships depends on the relational schemas held by both leaders and subordinates. Unfortunately, these two research areas have developed independently and have yet to intersect, which limits our understanding of how social interactions between leaders and subordinates impact employee voice behaviour. Based on research from both domains, the current study examines how the supervisor-subordinate relational schema affects employees' voice behaviour. Our proposal, grounded in complexity theory, suggests that the expectations of both leaders and subordinates about their relationship model determine whether employees choose to voice their opinions to their leaders. Analyses of data from a survey of 416 matched pairs of leaders and subordinates in China conducted using fsQCA and LPA largely support our view. The results indicate that the configuration of the supervisor-subordinate relational schema among leaders and subordinates can predict the level of employee voice behaviour. Additionally, this configuration is a natural subset of the population. These findings have important implications for improving employee voice behaviour in organizations.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2374892;Burned out by the binary: how misgendering of nonbinary employees contributes to workplace burnout. We examine nonbinary employees' experiences with misgendering in work contexts and draw from minority stress theory (Meyer, 2003) to understand the consequences of misgendering. Our findings from 29 semi-structured interviews with nonbinary individuals revealed that although being misgendered is a common and highly stressful experience (distal stressor), the emotional labor associated with anticipating and reacting to misgendering acts as an additional and more proximal stressor. Together, these stressors jointly contribute to all three components of employee burnout (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced professional efficacy). We also identified support from coworkers and supervisors (in preventing and addressing misgendering) as important ameliorating factors. As such, our findings provide support for the tenets of minority stress theory and extend this work by focusing specifically on nonbinary employees and on burnout, an important outcome for both employees and organizations. These findings provide a more complete understanding of the lived experiences of nonbinary employees and make unique contributions to the diversity/inclusion, gender studies, queer studies, work/life, and occupational health literatures.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2330983;Building cooperative and high-performance organizations with high-performance work systems: the role of firm age and industry dynamism. Although numerous empirical studies have linked human resource (HR) management systems, including systematic HR practices, such as high-performance work systems (HPWS), to superior organizational performance, our understanding of how these benefits vary among firms operating under different levels of environmental uncertainty is limited. By integrating insights from organizational theory, strategy, and strategic human resource management (SHRM), I theorize that an organization's internal and external environments-specifically firm age and industry dynamism-modulate the benefits derived from HPWS. Utilizing longitudinal data encompassing 1,585 firm-year observations across five waves from 2009 to 2017, I demonstrate that the positive impact of HPWS on organizational performance is most pronounced for younger firms in highly dynamic industries. Conversely, for older firms, this positive effect weakens as industry dynamism increases. Additionally, I discovered that cooperative norms serve as a crucial mediating mechanism. My findings mark a significant advance in our understanding of when and how firms, amidst varying degrees of environmental uncertainty, reap differential benefits from HPWS-especially through the mediation of cooperative norms.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2319794;Accounting professionals' legitimacy maintenance of modern slavery inspired extreme work practices in an emerging economy. It is well-established in the human resource management literature that high intensity and excessive workload can cause undesirable physiological, psychological, behavioural, and social outcomes. However, there is a need to theorise the process by which extreme work has been legitimised and embedded among professionals. In this paper, we view extreme workers as those professionals who contribute to their works beyond acceptable contractual obligations, either voluntarily for personal rewards or involuntarily due to the menace of penalty, or both. We chose to investigate how accounting professionals in India legitimise extreme work in their workplaces using exploratory qualitative research methods and applied economies of worth theoretical framework. Our findings demonstrate that senior accounting professionals with the assistance of professional associations can play an important role in mobilising professional and organisational resources to tackle extreme work in their accounting firms and the industry.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2317720;The devolution of human resource management responsibilities to line managers: a multi-level analysis of contextual influences. Patterns of devolution of human resource management responsibilities to line managers vary significantly, giving rise to the important question of what accounts for such variability in the assignment of these responsibilities. Building on theoretical insights from both contextual strategic human resource management and structural contingency theory, we conceptualise the combined role of both proximal and distal factors in the form of institutional, competitive, and heritage-based mechanisms in accounting for variations in devolution. Then, employing data from 5918 organisations across 35 countries, we test our ideas using multi-level modelling. We find that competitive and heritage mechanisms, as more proximal influences, offer explanatory power, while the more distal institutional factors included in our analysis do not reach significance. Our work underscores the importance of theorizing the role of multiple, co-occurring proximal and distal multi-level influences when seeking to unearth commonalities and differences in the uptake of devolution in different contexts. This study also complements the predominant managerialist view on the assignment of human resource management responsibilities to line managers commonplace in the literature.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2309150;Still waters run deep: differences in employee empowerment between public and private sector firms in India. The different structural contexts of public and private sector firms frame the specific organizational work environment. However, public-private comparative studies have been unable to isolate how these differences influence aspects of organizational work, such as employee empowerment, with similarities and differences among key constructs. We develop a contingency view of employee empowerment, theoretically arguing and empirically demonstrating how authentic leadership with different levels of organizational politics influences employee empowerment in different contextual settings, namely public vs. private sector firms. We present evidence of a three-way interaction. We surveyed 173 senior Indian managers working in public and private sectors to measure their perceptions of empowerment, authentic leadership, and organizational politics. Employing ordinary least-square regression, we tested for simple and complex interactions. We found that authentic leadership had interactive effects on how organizational politics and public-private differences impact empowerment. The differences in the effect of authentic leadership on employee empowerment between public and private firms became more, with an increase in organizational politics.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2125819;Performance goal orientation and unethical pro-organizational behavior: a moderated mediation model. Existing unethical pro-organizational behavior (UPB) literature suggests that it includes two definitional components: committing to achieving beneficial consequences for the organization and violating standards of ethical behavior. Existing research examining individual differences' effects on UPB has mainly focused on moral traits and largely ignored performance-related ones, such as performance goal orientation. To address this theoretical blind spot, drawing from the general risk-taking perspective, we investigated how and when performance goal orientations shape employee UPB. We first conducted a business simulation study (Study 1) with 86 undergraduate students and found that performance-approach goal orientation had a positive effect on UPB engagement. Next, we sampled 446 employees from 93 teams (Study 2). Results showed that the relationship between performance-approach goal orientation and UPB was mediated by risk taking. Furthermore, performance-avoidance goal orientation was negatively related to risk taking and subsequent UPB for individuals perceive lower levels of UPB injunctive norm induced by higher ethical leadership. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications, and offer several directions for future research.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2122729;Dominance and societal effects in HR practice transfer: the role of meso-level actors in diffusing and adapting the Japanese model in Indonesia. This article investigates how meso-level actors (MeLAs) contribute to HR practice transfer in diffusion and adaptation processes, drawing on the System-Society-Dominance-Corporate Effects (SSDC) framework to interpret the role of MeLAs in the transfer of the Japanese management model to the Indonesian automotive industry. We focus on two issues: i) the way Japanese MeLAs' training regimes in Japan affect the diffusion of the model and ii) the coordinated Japanese and Indonesian MeLAs strategy in seeking procedural influence through knowledge-sharing and in facilitating transfer activities over how the Japanese model is adapted in Indonesia. Our research adds to our limited understanding of the significance of MeLAs in processes of diffusion-adaptation in emerging market economies characterized by weak regulatory regimes and asymmetric socioeconomic power relations. Drawing on interviews with 75 key informants across Japan and Indonesia, we explore the significance of MeLAs from corporate and labor spheres alongside those of non-corporate MeLAs. Theoretically, this study extends the SSDC framework by highlighting MeLAs' influence in both diffusing conceptions of dominant management 'best practice' (dominance effects) and their role - and that of dominance effects - in shaping societal effects that inform how the model is adapted. We theorize the complex processes through which the effects identified in the SSDC framework are experienced by local actors, showing that they are neither monolithic nor mechanical in nature and thereby elaborating the inter-relationship in how dominance effects inform societal effects.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2090268;Informal network context: deepening the knowledge and extending the boundaries of social network research in international human resource management. While informal networking has been universally regarded as an important feature of expatriate effectiveness, respective network constructs (yongo, wasta, blat/svyazi, etc.) remain weakly understood when taking expatriates' ability to connect to local networks into account. Drawing on informal institution and social capital theory, we present informal networks as an important contextual factor in international human resource management (IHRM), relevant to the work of expatriates in particular. We define informal networks by pointing out their distinctive nature in contrast to social networks and developing central themes to guide future research in this area. This is achieved by integrating the informal network context into research themes relevant to the IHRM domain. In this article, seven research themes centering on focal research questions are developed, which, taken together, constitute a future research agenda and expand the typical domain of IHRM research in the informal network context.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2088242;The curvilinear effect of employee-experienced market-based HR systems on employee creativity in the Chinese context. Drawing on the cognitive evaluation theory, we examine the mediated curvilinear relationship between employee-experienced market-based human resource (HR) systems and creativity. Having used a sample consisting of 356 supervisor-subordinate dyads from Chinese companies, our study found employee-experienced market-based HR systems to have an inverted U-shaped relationship with employee creativity. We also found market-based HR systems to indirectly influence employee creativity via psychological safety, with there being an inverted U-shaped path from the systems to psychological safety. This study broadens the knowledge about the effects of market-based HR systems as a type of strategic human resource management and provides insights on how market-based HR systems influence employee creativity in emerging economies, such as in the Chinese context.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2054281;Empowering leadership improves employees' positive psychological states to result in more favorable behaviors. Based on workplace resources theories, especially conservation of resources theory, the present study examines if empowering leadership promotes subordinates' innovative work behavior and reduces workplace bullying through two mediators, an energic state (thriving at work) and an attentional state (job boredom). U.S. employees answered questionnaires at three times one month apart. The hypothesized mediation model was supported more strongly than alternative models. Empowering leadership at Time 1 fostered subordinates' thriving and alleviated their job boredom at Time 2. Greater thriving or less boredom resulted in more innovative work behavior and less bullying at Time 3. Together, the study shows the important roles of employees' energic and attentional states in explaining why the job resources provided in empowering leadership may affect subordinates' desirable and undesirable behaviors.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2029931;Negative workplace gossip and targets' subjective well-being: a moderated mediation model. Negative gossip is an everyday part of life and work whose outcomes have been the focus of a growing number of studies. However, the impact of negative workplace gossip on employees' subjective well-being (SWB) appears to have received no attention in the literature. Drawing on conservation of resources theory, we use time-lagged data from 243 employees in five firms in China to investigate the processes underlying the links between negative workplace gossip and SWB. Our findings show that negative workplace gossip has a significant negative effect on SWB, and that psychological distress mediates this relationship. We also find that emotional intelligence plays a moderating role between negative workplace gossip and targets' psychological distress. Our results indicate for the first time that negative workplace gossip increases psychological distress and lowers SWB among its targets. As a result, several managerial implications are suggested, such as seeking to reduce the prevalence of negative workplace gossip, offering early support to employees in psychological distress, and taking steps to raise the emotional intelligence level of staff.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1976244;Understanding the impact of family-to-work conflict and enrichment on the performance of entrepreneurial firms: A conservation of resources perspective. Entrepreneurs are critical human resources that have a significant impact on the performance of entrepreneurial firms. Yet, the nature of many entrepreneurial resources means that they are in demand by both their work (firms) and their families. Little is known about the impact that such dual demands might have on an entrepreneur's ability to manage their own resources for their firm's performance. Drawing upon conservation of resources (COR) theory and family-work literature, this paper develops a model to examine how family-to-work conflict (FWC) and family-to-work enrichment (FWE) shape the performance of entrepreneurial firms, directly and indirectly, through the mediation of entrepreneurial commitments. The model also explores the potential role of entrepreneurs' key personal resources as a unique type of human resource that utilizes entrepreneurs' internal dispositions to moderate the relationship between FWC/FWE and entrepreneurial commitments (and, hence, business performance). Empirical results from a study of 261 entrepreneurial firms in China provide support for our conceptual model. The paper has important implications for both HRM and entrepreneurship research and practices.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1967422;What drives employees to participate in corporate social responsibility? A personal characteristics-CSR capacity-organizational reinforcing model of employees' motivation for voluntary CSR activities. Employees' participation in corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a channel that not only helps corporations convey their social responsibility messages but also, in the long run, enhances stakeholder-organization relationships and builds corporate image. Given the important role employees play in CSR, inadequate attention is paid to their motivation to engage in voluntary CSR activities, and there is a research gap in the literature in terms of a lack of a systematic view of that motivation. Therefore, this study seeks to narrow this gap by exploring the factors influencing individual employees' motivation to take part in voluntary CSR activities, using a qualitative approach, with empirical data collected from employees of leading CSR companies in Vietnam. Through grounded theory analysis, our findings lead to the proposal of a personal characteristics - CSR capacity - organizational reinforcing model, revealing different intrinsic and extrinsic elements, categorized into personal characteristics, CSR capacities and organizational reinforcement, that motivate employees to participate and engage in voluntary CSR activities. Our findings and the proposed model offer a significant contribution to the CSR literature and organization management theories, and also provide insights and practical implications for those involved in CSR endeavors, including human resource (HR) managers in organizations.

10.1080/09585192.2019.1579250;Resource orchestration of firm-specific human capital and firm performance-the role of collaborative human resource management and entrepreneurial orientation. Firm-specific human capital (HC) is widely recognised as the most important resource for superior firm performance. Contemporary literature on the resource-based view (RBV) and resource orchestration has stressed the importance of organising resources, such as firm-specific HC, in order to fully exploit them. However, companies with idiosyncratic resources cannot rely on established resource exploitation practices, making the exploitation of firm-specific HC a complex issue. Nevertheless, few studies have empirically examined how to orchestrate firm-specific HC. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine how resource orchestration-operationalised as collaborative human resource management (CHRM) and entrepreneurial orientation (EO) both individually and combined-moderates the relationship between firm-specific HC and firm performance. Based on a sample of 151 Swedish manufacturing firms, the findings demonstrate that CHRM and EO do not independently influence the relationship between firm-specific HC and performance. However, firms with firm-specific HC benefit from either being highly entrepreneurial and relying on CHRM or being non-entrepreneurial and not focusing on CHRM;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1928729;The role of inter-team relational coordination in the high-performance work systems-team performance linkage. Building mainly upon the resource-based theory, social exchange theory, and relational theory, this paper integrates three research streams that propose how human capital, affective commitment, and inter-team relational coordination relate to each other in the mediation between high-performance work systems (HPWSs) and team performance. Questionnaires were distributed to employees and supervisors in 189 teams from different companies in Chile to test a sequential mediation model of the HPWS-team performance relationship, using the mediation paths of human capital and affective commitment as antecedents of inter-team relational coordination. Structural Equation Modeling is used to assess whether data support the hypothesized pathways. Results support a mediated sequential path in which HPWSs influence human capital and affective commitment, which in turn affect inter-team relational coordination, while the three mediators influence team performance. Furthermore, post-hoc analyses suggest that the Opportunities component of the Ability-Motivation-Opportunity (AMO) model of human resource practices has a stronger and direct impact on the inter-team relational coordination mediation path than the abilities and motivation components of the AMO model. This study contributes to the understanding of how human capital, affective commitment and inter-team relational coordination relate to each other within the mediation of HPWSs-team performance relationship.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The diversity of practices observed in small enterprises demands a new evaluation of HRM with respect to its phenotypes and functions. By bringing HRM back to its functional requirements as represented by the need to control the human side of work as well as the differentiation and integration of tasks, we develop a configurational model of eight ideal types of HRM, that resonate in previous research as well as in emerging organization types in the networked economy. Based on varying positions along the hierarchy, formalities and input- or output-oriented dimensions of control, we discern craft employers, traditional owner-managers, and strategic-, knowledge-, and bleak house entrepreneurs from subcontracted work, alliances and partnerships. Because control serves as a bridge between agency and structure, the proposed classification offers an analytical starting point for detecting, describing, contrasting, comparing and contextualizing empirically observed HRM configurations in a broad diversity of small enterprises. The approach offers a mid-range theory, which allows for generalization across small enterprises without the risk of losing peculiar responses to enacting HRM.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2020.1871397;Birds of a feather flock together: the relationship between managers' and employees' perceptions of HR practices. Human resource (HR) scholars argue that employees perform better when their perceptions of HR practices are consistent with those of their managers. However, few studies have examined the circumstances under which employees are likely to develop consistent perceptions of HR practices as their managers. Drawing on social information processing theory, we investigate the relationship between managers' and employees' perceptions of HR practices and explore the factors that moderate this relationship. Cross-level analyses of data from 380 employees matched to 32 department managers in 23 Chinese state-owned enterprises reveal a positive relationship between managers' and employees' perceptions of HR practices. This relationship is stronger when managers and employees report similar levels of power distance, long-term orientation, and collectivism. In addition, the moderating effect of long-term orientation similarity is stronger for employees with a high level of cognitive cultural intelligence.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Given ever increasing work and nonwork demands, achieving work-nonwork (WNW) balance is an important priority for many employees. Scholars have only recently settled on a definition of WNW balance as multidimensional and, as such, our understanding of its antecedents and outcomes is limited. Drawing on Conservation of Resources theory, we explore how organizations can support employees to achieve WNW balance and whether 'balanced' employees are more productive at work and satisfied with life. In detail, we hypothesize that the positive effect of supervisor WNW support (FSS) on employees' life satisfaction and job performance is mediated by multidimensional WNW balance. We find, across two studies with two waves each, that only the dimension of WNW balance effectiveness and not the dimension of WNW balance satisfaction mediated the relationships between FSS, life satisfaction (Study 1 and 2) and self-rated job performance (Study 1). The relationship between FSS and supervisor-rated job performance (Study 2) was not mediated by either WNW balance dimension. As such, organizations can facilitate WNW balance through FSS, while 'balanced' employees seem indeed happier with their life and consider themselves to be better performing at work. We discuss the unexpected finding regarding the superior role of WNW balance effectiveness over WNW balance satisfaction for our outcomes in relation to the conceptualization of WNW balance as multidimensional and delineate important theoretical and practical implications.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This article applies institutional theory to analyse the state and direction of human resource management as an occupation. Using Japan as a case study, we apply a framework by Zietsma et al. (2017) to demonstrate how an analysis of institutional logics and institutional infrastructure helps to understand the state of and tensions within the HR occupation. Abstracting from the case of Japan, we argue that such systematic stocktaking of an HR occupational field along a neo-institutional theoretical model can offer valuable insights into possible (re-)configurations of the field that go beyond the somewhat normative prescription of the 'HR professional' in the Western literature.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2211710;Managing emotions in ongoing service relationships: new intrinsic and extrinsic emotion regulation strategies from aged care. Managing emotions at work can be challenging for employees in service roles. Most emotional labor research has been conducted in settings of brief service interactions with strangers. Yet, many traditional family roles, such as aged and child care are now outsourced to personal service roles that have ongoing relationships with clients. The continuing nature of those relationships may result in employees using previously unknown strategies to regulate emotions. To develop an understanding of intrinsic and extrinsic emotion regulation (ER) strategies in service relationships, we interviewed 42 aged care employees in China. Using template analysis we found three new employee-client relationship-based intrinsic ER strategies (i.e. family appreciation, filial reappraisal and deliberate distancing), a self-based strategy (i.e. self-deterioration anticipation) and three client-based strategies (i.e. client deterioration anticipation, vulnerability justification and meaning identification) in managing one's own emotions in service relationships. When managing others' emotions in ongoing service settings, a new relationship-based extrinsic ER strategy (i.e. communal bonding) along with situation-based and client-based extrinsic ER strategies were identified. Employees can regulate their own and others' emotions by crafting their relationships with clients. This study suggests that service relationship is a critical dimension of client interactions and should be considered in workplace ER research.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This special issue aims to advance our understanding of talent management in emerging market economies. The uniqueness of this special issue was that it invited and accepted contributions on talent management in emerging countries at multiple levels. At the macro level, i.e. from a country level perspective, given the prevalence of state intervention in emerging economies, we were interested in understanding the impact of state ownership/intervention on talent management in those markets. From a meso level, i.e. from a firm level perspective, we were interested in empirical evidence, as to how talent management contributes to performance in emerging markets. Finally, at a micro level, i.e. from an individual level, we were interested in empirical work on research topics such as the career expectations of talent in emerging markets, and the factors that determine the attractiveness of employers for employees in emerging markets. The papers that represented contextual data from lesser-represented emerging countries, were included in this special issue. More specifically, these papers contextually represented the emerging countries namely Nepal, Russia, The United Arab Emirates, Vietnam, Poland, Iraq and the last study included a collection of data from 19 African countries. We contribute through this editorial piece by comparing the seven papers included in this special issue to both, previous work in the last two decades or so (2000-2022), globally and within International Journal of Human Resource Management, and identify meaningful future research directions.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Employee engagement is critical for the sustenance of organizations. Scholars have highlighted that the employer-employee interaction is an essential mechanism that enhances employee engagement. The communicative and interactional features of AI applications in HRM allow for a personalized and individualized approach to employees. The proliferation of AI-based solutions is increasing in various dimensions of HR business processes, leading to enhanced employee experiences and job satisfaction. However, this research domain is exploratory concerning the impact of AI-mediation HRM practices. Based on a multi-source, time-lagged study spanning over ten months in a multinational company, we have investigated the impact of AI-enabled chatbots on employee engagement in the present study. We have also examined climate for trust as the path through which chatbots impact engagement. Moreover, we have analyzed the implications of AI-enabled chatbots on employee outcomes based on their age and past performance. The contributions of the study to theory and practice have also been discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2086014;Contested fields of equality, diversity and inclusion at work: an institutional work lens on power relations and actors' strategies in Germany and Turkey. In this paper, we explore how institutional actors push or resist equality, diversity and inclusion in light of power relations in their respective country contexts. We conducted interviews with a range of institutional actors, including governmental organizations, employer representatives, unions, professional associations, and civil society organizations working on EDI issues in Germany and Turkey, two countries with very different socioeconomic and political settings. Our findings suggest that EDI fields are structured by country-specific power relations: they appear as competitively dispersed in Germany and politically polarized in Turkey, depending on the social position of the actors and the type of field fragmentation. These field characteristics, in turn, nurture different patterns of actors' strategies such as framing and mobilizing aimed at maintaining or disrupting the institutionalized status quo of EDI. We propose that a critical, power-sensitive institutional work approach to EDI is a useful lens through which to examine extra-organizational country contexts in international HRM research and, in particular, context-sensitive studies of EDI. As a practical implication, EDI and HR managers will be sensitized to the relevance of building coalitions with external stakeholders if they are to advance EDI within their organizations.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In European countries, the COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to a demanding work situation for office employees who have been required to work from home (hereinafter referred to as remote workers). Due to curfews, school closures, and leisure restrictions in Austria, remote work circumstances have changed compared to before the pandemic. By combining event system theory with transactional stress theory, we aim to identify the most important resources for maintaining remote workers' well-being, perceived productivity, and engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected daily data (five working days for each remote worker) once from March to May 2020 (2222 employees) and again from November 2020 to January 2021 (1268 employees) and explored the role of personal (self-goal setting, self-efficacy, home-office experience), external (equipment at home), and organizational (work-related and social) resources for changes in well-being, perceived productivity, and engagement. Well-being and engagement decreased less when remote workers indicated high resources of self-efficacy and social support at the beginning of the crises. Results further reveal that an improvement in resources from the first to the second measurement was associated with a reduced decline in well-being, productivity, and engagement, respectively. We discuss implications for HRM and provide suggestions for future research.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The purpose of this study was to investigate the personal factors that influence goal setting in the coaching process. In an experiment, we examined self-set goals as mediator and implicit theories of ability (ITA) as moderator of the impact of guidance versus facilitation styles of coaching on two types of performance, analogous and adaptive. Participants (n = 137) were coached to use one of two software programs, PowerPoint or Excel. We found that ITA moderated the mediating effects of self-set goals on the coaching style-performance relationship. Our findings support the importance of motivational fit by identifying the conditions under and process by which coaching enhances performance and adaptation. Implications for theory and management practice are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This study examines the status quo of workplace gender (in)equality research in the Chinese context. By reviewing 173 articles from 96 English journals throughout 1988-2020, it reveals that various forms of discrimination still exist against women in the labour market and workplaces. In particular, the persisting, and arguably widening, gender pay gap reflects not only the sticky floor, but also the glass ceiling, effects. The review also shows that researchers have tended to favour quantitative more than qualitative methods. While a range of theoretical perspectives has been mobilized to explain manifestations of gender inequality, a critical feminist approach has been rare for political, institutional, cultural, and research capability reasons. Moreover, there is limited interest in the notion of (gender) diversity management, suggesting that diversity management has not yet become part of the strategic HRM research in the Chinese context. Similarly, extant HRM and organizational behaviour research rarely treats gender (in)equality as a key construct to illuminate the potential effect of such a (perceived) form of organizational injustice on the well-being of female and minority male employees. Based on our review analysis, we identify several opportunities for future research to advance workplace gender scholarship and practice.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1960751;Exploring mental illness in the workplace:the role of HR professionals and processes. In this overview, we introduce a special issue featuring six articles on various aspects related to the role of Human Resource Management in managing mental illness at work. This introduction article starts with an overview of what we know and do not know about mental illness in the context of work and why more insights related to mental illness at work are much needed. The special issue features a unique set of articles that employ different methodologies and approaches to studying mental illness at work. Theoretical perspectives presented include tension-centred theory, ethical HRM, diversity theory, person-job fit, and critical disability studies. The articles outline and discuss HRM policies, practices and strategies used to manage individuals with mental illness, the experiences of individuals with mental illness in the context of work, and includes a review on disclosure of mental illness in the workplace. Recommendations for continued research are presented and a range of theoretical lenses and perspectives are discussed as possible foundations for future inquiry focusing on context, sampling, and methods, as well as further empirical investigations of the full range of stakeholders' perspectives (i.e. individuals with mental illness;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper explores issues relating to talent management in Vietnam's emerging market economy, particularly knowledge transfer, skills application, and linkage effects within and across firms. The paper offers the concept of 'value' to consider employees' knowledge, skills, and attributes, and 'value flows' as the deployment of these resources. This value-based approach to talent management is illustrated using qualitative data collected from semi-structured interviews with Vietnamese international graduates' and members of their employment networks. The focus on international graduates considers the Vietnamese government's policies of internationalisation of higher education as a strategic investment to improve the quality of human resources to meet the country's socioeconomic development needs for global integration. The paper offers some implications for policies and practices to develop and harness talent in emerging economies like Vietnam.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1177/23409444231184481;The impact of SME leader's psychological capital on strategic responses during crisis. This study investigates how the Psychological Capital (PsyCap) of small and medium enterprises (SME) leaders has influenced their strategic responses, ultimately impacting the performance of their companies, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Embedded within research on behavioral micro-foundations in strategy, and based on the resource-based theory (RBT) of the individual entrepreneur as well as positive organizational behavior literature, we hypothesize that SME leaders' psychological resources can act as a strategic advantage during crises by making them adopt cost-cutting and investment measures for their companies performance. By using a sample of 372 SMEs, we find that while leaders mostly use both measures, leaders with a high PsyCap prefer adopting investment measures, which positively influences the performance of their companies during a crisis. However, adopting cost-cutting measures lowers performance. We contribute to the entrepreneurship literature by using PsyCap in the context of the RBT of the individual entrepreneur and shedding light on which measures sustain or increase SMEs' performance during a crisis.

10.1080/09585192.2024.2428343;Institutions, economies and downsizing: evidence across time and countries. Downsizing is a legitimate yet highly disruptive human resource management practice that organisations can activate when costs need to be cut. We adopt an institutionalist lens to explore how both legislative and economic forces combine to shape organisations' adoption of employee downsizing practices. We conduct multilevel mixed-effects ordered probit regression analyses on our survey data on human resource management practices from 29 countries and four rounds of data collection spanning seventeen years. The findings indicate that variations in downsizing practices can be partly explained by differences in national legal institutions as well as by prevailing economic conditions. Importantly, we also find that constraints imposed by national regulatory institutions may be relaxed during periods of economic crisis. We theorise the interaction of coercive, mimetic and normative isomorphic effects to understand how organisational operating contexts are dynamic, whereby both constraints and opportunities can vary over time.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2325548;Sustainable human resource management: the perspectives of Italian human resource managers. Over the past two decades, sustainable human resource management (sustainable HRM) has emerged as a new approach to human resource management. Sustainable HRM takes a stakeholder-inclusive perspective to ensure the sustainable development of organizations along multiple objectives (financial, social, environmental, and organizational). Human resource (HR) managers are key actors in sustainable HRM implementation. However, how these important stakeholders perceive sustainable HRM remains understudied in the growing literature. This qualitative study explores how 32 HR managers in Italy construct the meaning of sustainable HRM and perceive their roles in and the barriers to implementing a sustainable HRM strategy. The findings reveal that Italian HR managers interpret sustainable HRM in line with the triple bottom line sustainability framework but give particular prominence to the social dimension. We develop a framework of HR managers' roles in the sustainable HRM paradigm comprising sustainability strategy owners, social innovators, corporate social responsibility (CSR) partnership architects, genuine employee champions, and administrative experts. Additionally, we develop a model of the barriers to sustainable HRM adoption. This study advances the sustainable HRM literature by providing a contextualized, country-specific understanding of sustainable HRM and frameworks for the roles of HR managers under a sustainable HRM paradigm and the barriers to its adoption.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Pakistan's manufacturing industry is under a lot of pressure to deal with environmental issues such as carbon monoxide emissions, poisonous compounds, and manufacturing waste. Green HR practices are considered to be fundamental pillars and are considered to be crucial in the development and optimization of environmentally sustainable initiatives. Hence, the objective of this research is to analyze the effects of green HR practices implemented in the manufacturing sector of Pakistan on employees' proactivity with regard to environmental issues. The data was acquired through the distribution of a survey questionnaire to manufacturing firms. The data was analyzed using SMART-PLS. The findings demonstrated that green HR practices have a substantial effect on the proactive behavior of employees. Additionally, the results indicated that organizational identification acts as a complementary mediator between green HR practices and the proactive behavior of employees in reducing environmental effects. Furthermore, it was discovered that proactive personality acted as a catalyst to enhance the impact of GHRM on the proactive behavior of employees with regard to environmental initiatives. Future research directions and managerial implications were also discussed.The study offers a conceptual framework linking GHRM and employees' proactive behavior for environmental impact in the manufacturing sector of Pakistan.Based on the theory of planned behavior, the study extends GHRM research by including a mediator called 'organizational identification'.With the support of trait activation theory, proactive personality is used as a moderator to strengthen the relationship between GHRM and employees' proactive environmental behavior.Results indicate a positive and statistically significant association between green HR practices and employees' proactive environmental behavior.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Despite the shared research interest in multinational enterprises (MNEs) in international business (IB) and international human resource management (IHRM), the two fields of studies have been criticized for the lack of dialogues and collaborations that might be beneficial to extending the scope of knowledge in each. At the same time, both IB and IHRM have expanded into the international development area, evidenced by the growing interest in the role of MNEs in promoting or hampering the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This perspective paper aims to address some of the critiques, challenge existing assumptions, and provide examples of research that critically examines the role of MNEs in promoting or hampering the realization of the SDGs. This paper highlights the emerging common ground between IB and IHRM, and identifies agendas for future theoretical and applied enquiries.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Danish retail banking is characterized by a role conflict between sales and advice. Through the lens of identity work, this study explores how bankers negotiate this conflict by seeking to make sense of themselves and justify the work that they do. We show that bankers are keenly aware of the role conflicts they face in doing their jobs, but they also discover ways of making these conflicts meaningfully productive for themselves, their employers, and their customers. To explain these findings, we introduce Hartmut Rosa's concept of resonance, provisionally understood as a processual and relational conceptualization of well-being. This leads to a conceptualization of bankers' identity work of managing the sales-advice tension as striving for professional resonance, the attainment of which is possible through three strategies: an advice orientation, which can be understood as a protection of resonance;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Evidence shows that working time mismatch, i.e. the difference between actual and desired working hours, is negatively related to employees' job satisfaction. Using longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, we examine the potential moderating effect of working time autonomy on this relation and we also consider the corresponding role of gender. First, individual fixed effects panel estimations reaffirm both the negative link of working hours mismatch and the positive relation of working time autonomy to employees' job satisfaction. Second, our results show a positive moderating relation of working time autonomy on the link between mismatch and job satisfaction. Third, our analyses hint at gender-specific differences: particularly women seem to benefit from the moderation role of working time autonomy.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Leveraging intersectionality as a lens, we explore the life-history accounts of former military migrants (MMs) on their transition out of the military service into civilian work. Data for the inquiry comes from in-depth interviews with MMs from West African Commonwealth countries who joined the UK military between 1998 and 2010. Focusing on the intersectionality of contexts, situatedness, positionalities, and identities of MMs, we theorise how this group of veterans account for their '(un)gilded' transition from military service to joining civilian work. Played out as a process of 'way-finding', MMs' transition out of military service into civilian work, we found, is characterised by four salient tropes: sculpturing an angel in a block of marble;art;" and the show of 'grace under pressure'. Providing situated insights into the transitioning experiences of MMs, our study delineates how this group of veterans rationalise their career choices and adds nuance to how they draw on their intersecting migrant and veteran identities to respond to and overcome everyday structural barriers. We conclude with a discussion of our findings and their implications for the theory and practice of human resource management and the employment of veterans in civilian work."",art";;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2109375;Advancing understanding of HRM in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs): critical questions and future prospects. A notable paradox of HRM research is that while small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) form the dominant private sector employer across the globe, they remain dramatically underrepresented in scholarship. This is significant as there are a number of SME specific characteristics that shape HRM in this context, raising questions around the relevance and applicability of dominant understanding of HRM. In this paper we outline six such SME characteristics captured by the acronym RECIPE and outline their implications for HRM. We then introduce seven special issue papers which serve to advance understanding of HRM in SMEs. Drawing together key insights, we conclude by proposing a number of routes for future research and deeper contextualisation of HRM in SMEs. These include broadening the theoretical palette, challenging conventional assumptions, moving beyond an exclusive HPWS focus, incorporating employee perspectives, coupled with the need to cast a wider methodological net.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2077126;How CEOs' inclusive leadership fuels employees' well-being: a three-level model. Drawing on social learning theory and social information processing theory, we propose that department managers' inclusive leadership, and department-level inclusive climate serially mediate the effect of CEOs' inclusive leadership on employees' well-being. We also posit that organizational structure not only moderates the relationship between CEOs' inclusive leadership and department managers' inclusive leadership, but also plays a role in the relationship between department managers' inclusive leadership and department-level inclusive climate. By analyzing paired data of 106 CEOs, 204 department managers, and 975 employees, we found that department managers' inclusive leadership mediated the relationship between CEOs' inclusive leadership and employees' well-being, but the serial mediation role of department managers' inclusive leadership and department-level inclusive climate in the effect of CEOs' inclusive leadership on employees' well-being was not supported. Organizational structure moderated the relationship between CEOs' inclusive leadership and department managers' inclusive leadership. Specifically, when organizations have organic structures rather than mechanistic structures, the relationship between CEOs' inclusive leadership and department managers' inclusive leadership is stronger. However, the moderating role of organizational structure in the relationship between department managers' inclusive leadership and inclusive department climate was not supported.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2047755;Managing emotional labour: the importance of organisational support for managing police officers in England and Italy. This paper empirically examines the impact of organisational psychological support on employees' outcomes as an example of the 'Common Good HRM' model on the well-being - performance continuum of police officers, using a Conservation of Resources (COR) theoretical framework. The study uses Structural Equation Modelling to analyse data from 220 Italian police and 228 English police officers to compare the impact of Perceived Organisational Support (POS) on organisational stress, employees' resilience, and engagement. The findings show that low Perceived Organisational Support (POS) leads to high stress, which then comprises employees' resilience and likely demotivates them from being engaged on the job, explaining approximately half of their engagement. Stress and resilience also mediate the relationship between POS and engagement. COR theory explains that when POS is low, employees perceive a resource loss spiral which compromises their wellbeing, and consequently, police officers' engagement is low. The contribution of this paper is that it shows how organisational support is an integral part of managing emotional labour and therefore demonstrates how the 'Common Good HRM' model has the potential to protect emotional labour more effectively.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This study investigates why and when coworker knowledge sharing encourages employee voice behavior by exploring psychological safety as a mediator and promotion focus as a moderator. We tested the hypotheses using 68 dyads (study 1) and 289 dyads (study 2) collected from South Korea. In both studies, we found the positive indirect relationship between coworker knowledge sharing and voice behavior through psychological safety. Moreover, in Study 2, we examined how promotion focus moderates the positive effects of coworker knowledge sharing on voice behavior via psychological safety. The implications and directions for future research are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

If HR managers wish to influence the careers of professional staff, it is important to understand their career aspirations and what determines them. This paper reports a study of the experiences of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) women professionals that shape their careers and working lives. Qualitative data from 39 interviews identifies a distinct set of influences on their career decisions linked to the intersection of their gender and ethnic identities. In particular, it reveals how the mechanisms of fit and accommodation play a role in shaping career adjustment. The paper contributes to career theory by demonstrating the role of mesostructures in the form of career scripts in exploring the interplay between individual agency and structure. It also contributes by incorporating reference group theory and highlighting the role of reference groups in shaping and transmitting career scripts. In so doing it reveals the potential longer-term implications for careers of relational influences on career choice. The analysis highlights the need for HR managers and HR researchers to be aware of the hidden influences on the career decisions of BAME women.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Although family-supportive supervision (FSS) has been identified as one of the most useful social resources for reducing the occurrence of work interference with family (WIF), relatively little is known about the boundary conditions and the underlying mechanisms through which this relationship occurs. Drawing on conservation of resources (COR) theory, we examined how and when FSS relates to WIF in two field studies, focusing on family-role overload as a moderator and employee task crafting as a mediator. Results from Study 1, using multi-wave data from a high-technology firm, showed that family role-overload moderated the relationship between FSS and WIF such that the relationship was stronger for employees with more family role-overload than for those with less family role-overload. Results from Study 2, using multi-wave data from employees working in different industries, revealed that employee task crafting mediated the interactive effect of FSS and family-role overload on WIF. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper introduces a socio-economic perspective on the relationships of idiosyncratic deals (i.e. i-deals) with motivation to continue working beyond retirement. On the basis of work adjustment theory, we expected that i-deals enable employees to engage in innovative behavior and professional development, through which they experience more work engagement, subsequently facilitating higher motivation to continue working. Moreover, on the basis of signaling theory, we introduced two socio-economic factors to explain when i-deals are most effective in the context of the current study among teachers: municipal child population growth and municipal unemployment. A study among 1,210 teachers in the Netherlands was conducted to test the mediation and moderation model. Results show positive indirect relationships of growth i-deals with motivation to continue working through innovative work behavior, professional development and work engagement, while indirect relationships were negative for accommodative i-deals. Moreover, child population growth boosted the relationships of i-deals, while unemployment accentuated the effects of professional development. The study contributes to the literature by showing the importance of socio-economic factors in explaining the relationships of i-deals and individualized HRM.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1917641;Global differences in applicant reactions to virtual interview synchronicity. Advances in employment assessment technology have increasingly enabled employers to recruit from around the world by allowing interviewees to respond to live or pre-recorded video or text prompts live or via asynchronous video recordings. Despite their greater scheduling convenience, asynchronous virtual interviews decrease applicants' ability to engage in impression management and relationship building and therefore may negatively impact applicant reactions compared to their synchronous counterparts. Further, national culture has the potential to influence reactions to virtual interview synchronicity. Previous research has yielded mixed results, with some studies suggesting that culture can moderate how applicants react to selection tests and some finding little or no effect. Drawing from applicant reactions and media richness theories, we integrate Hofstede's cultural dimensions to investigate the role of national culture in applicant reactions to virtual interview synchronicity in a sample of 644,905 virtual interviewees from 46 countries. Overall, our findings demonstrate that, though they rated both highly, interviewees around the world were generally more satisfied with synchronous virtual interviews and found them to be more effective than asynchronous virtual interviews. Three dimensions of national culture-uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation, and indulgence-had small to medium moderating effects on these relationships.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1894213;High Performance Work Systems and Innovation in New Zealand SMEs: Testing Firm Size and Competitive Environment Effects. While the links between High Performance Work Systems (HPWS) and performance are established, we extend this literature by (1) focusing on new products/services innovation and (2) testing relationships on SMEs (up to 250 employees). Specifically, we test a path model whereby HPWS influences human capital and ultimately innovation. Furthermore, to better understand potential resource differences within SMEs of different size, and the business environment context operated in, we also test (3) firm size and (4) competitive rivalry as moderators. Combining these factors, we test moderated mediation models and use a sample of 253 SMEs with time-lagged data. Findings show HPWS are positively related to a firm's human capital and innovation, and the direct effect of HPWS is partially mediated by human capital. Moderation effects highlight that firm size is most important, with larger SMEs outperforming smaller SMEs only when they have high HPWS. Greater competitive rivalry in conjunction with HPWS (2-way) and for larger SMEs (3-way) produces the highest levels of human capital. Finally, a moderated mediation effect is found for firm size, showing that the indirect effect of HPWS on innovation (through human capital) strengthens as SMEs get larger. The implications for HPWS and SME innovation are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Our study examines the role digitalisation plays in how various stakeholder groups (HR and line managers) identify talent and whether digitalisation transforms the role of HR professionals in identifying talent. By employing a qualitative case study with multiple embedded units of analysis, we show how the same digital talent management technology produced different ways of identifying talent even within the one organisation. In one social context, the material properties of the technology dominated, while in another the existing social context and relationships prevailed over the material properties of the technology. Our findings have implications for understanding digital transformations by acknowledging what factors influence the role that digitalisation and automation have on the perceived legitimacy of HR professionals. We discuss these implications for talent management scholarship and the HR profession.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1177/23409444211002218;CSR and corporate taxes: Substitutes or complements?. There is a debate in academia and the business world on whether tax payments should be considered part of firms' social responsibility. Existing literature provides conflicting evidence on the relationship between corporate tax payments and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Borrowing a concept from a behavioral theory of the firm (BTOF), this study attempts to present a more refined model on the relationship between the two. The results in this study reveal that as firms' performance rises further above their aspiration level, they are less likely to show better CSR performances and are also less likely to avoid taxes. Firms performing just above their aspiration level show higher CSR performances and firms performing nearby (both below and above) their aspiration level avoid more taxes. In conclusion, firms' CSR and tax payment decisions are related to the desire to meet or beat an aspiration level or sustain competitive advantage than being ethical or unethical.JEL CLASSIFICATION M14;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2429523;Legitimacy work of employer brand managers: how to find approval for employer branding policies and measures within an organisation?. Although organisations rely on employer brands, knowledge regarding management practices used to convince internal stakeholders from such engagements is limited. Consequently, this study examines employer brand manager's legitimacy work. Building on structuration theory, it details the management actions taken to secure approval and structural reasons justifying an organisation's engagement with employer brands. Using data from 69 organisations in Austria, this study evaluates how conviction regarding employer branding policies and measures emerged and identifies five key management practices: dramatising, radicalising, distributing, pragmatizing, demonstrating. These practices underscore contextuality in legitimacy work, illustrating how managers adapt their strategies to different phases in employer branding. This study contributes to existing literature by clarifying the legitimacy issues in intra-organisational management of employer brands, expanding our understanding of organisational politics and the role of structures in employer brand management. Additionally, it offers practical insights to help employer brand managers navigate the complexities of their roles more effectively and gain support for their initiatives by using pioneer, partner, and follower strategies.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2390986;Work and family interaction management: the case for zigzag working. The present study seeks to advance understanding of the interaction of work and family roles. Typically, while the intersection of these domains is established as either being detrimental (i.e. work-family conflict) or beneficial (i.e. work-family enrichment), we argue there is a fundamental issue with timing. Specifically, we offer zigzag working as an approach to understanding how work and family interact. We suggest, rather than roles operating separately (e.g. work to family or family to work), the reality of work is where employees have work and family roles intersecting simultaneously. We believe this provides unique insights for those with dependent responsibilities, representing potentially both a unique challenge and benefit. Our study has two samples (n = 318 employees and n = 373 managers) and we find support for zigzag working at the day-level and while it is positively related to work-family conflict dimensions it is also positively related to happiness. Overall, our paper offers a new lens on work-family border negotiation, providing empirical evidence showing that zigzag working does occur and that it appears to have unique properties. Importantly, zigging and zagging around work and dependents during a typical day represents both positive and negative effects, highlighting a unique occurrence within the literature.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2326843;A meta-analysis of the antecedents of flexible work arrangements utilization: based on Job demands-resources model. The rapid development of internet technology has enabled organizations to implement flexible work arrangements (FWA) on a large scale. The COVID-19 global pandemic has further intensified this trend, making FWA a vital aspect of HRM to maintain organizational operations. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the causes of FWA utilization and implement effective strategies to achieve optimal outcomes. We propose a framework for FWA utilization antecedents based on the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model and test it using meta-analysis. Drawing on 104 studies (108 independent samples) with 1,034,603 participants, we examine the relationship between FWA utilization and its job-related antecedents. Our findings generally support the expected relationships across two categories of FWA antecedents, namely job resources and job demands. We also identify demographics and masculinity/femininity culture as moderators that influence these relationships. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and practical implications to guide HR managers in developing effective FWA strategies that meet the needs of both employees and organizations.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The present study aggregates the extant literature on workplace politics and identifies themes to develop a comprehensive understanding of the field. Based on a portfolio of 68 studies collected from different electronic databases, an extensive systematic literature review was undertaken following Rowley & Slack's methodology. The study segregates the organizational politics literature into antecedents, consequences, and boundary conditions. Furthermore, antecedents, consequences, and boundary conditions are discussed from the individual, job, and organizational levels. Based on the identified themes, the study proposes a conceptual model and future research directions that scholars could use to guide practitioners in making organizations a better place to work.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2241815;Mitigating medical brain drain: the role of developmental HRM and the focus on opportunities in reducing the self-initiated expatriation of young professionals. Although 'brain drain' from emerging economies is a well-documented problem, research on how Human Resource Management (HRM) can potentially address it is still scarce. Based on Signaling Theory, we argue that developmental HRM practices in home countries reduce self-initiated expatriation (SIE) of young healthcare professionals by increasing their focus on opportunities in their home country. Additionally, we hypothesize that individual financial stability as a personal resource constitutes an important boundary condition, as developmental HRM's positive effect on the focus on opportunities and its indirect negative effect on SIE intention may be even stronger for individuals with lower financial resources. We tested and found support for our hypotheses using a sample of 184 junior doctors in Lithuania in a time-lagged study. By bridging the HRM and SIE literature, our study extends the existing knowledge about the outcomes of HRM and highlights the importance of home country HRM in explaining SIE intention above and beyond its traditionally considered antecedents. In this way, our study has major theoretical and practical implications for decision-makers at organizational and national levels in managing brain drain from emerging economies.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2117992;Green HRM through social exchange revisited: when negotiated exchanges shape cooperation. Recent research on green human resource management suggests that the social exchange process is conducive to employees behaving pro-environmentally. Previous studies have focused exclusively on reciprocal exchange and have largely overlooked the possibility that negotiated exchange also occurs. In this paper, a research model is developed to test whether the effect of green human resource management on employee eco-initiatives through the mediation of supervisory support for the environment is conditioned by felt responsibility for change and negotiated exchanges. Using data from a two-wave study, the findings show that the mediating effect is stronger at high levels of negotiated exchange only for employees displaying low levels of felt responsibility for change. The results also indicate that negotiated exchanges do not intervene in the case of employees exhibiting high levels of felt responsibility for change. This study provides new insights for understanding how social exchange operates in an environmental sustainability context.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2099751;The rhetorics of 'agile' and the practices of 'agile working': Consequences for the worker experience and uncertain implications for HR practice. The various rhetorics of 'agile', 'agility', and 'agile working' (AW) set an agenda for new ways of working and have recently gained traction in popular management discourse, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet conceptually, these rhetorical varieties of 'agile' are underdeveloped in the academic literature. In this article we examine the stream of AW as being a particularly influential rhetoric. AW is critically evaluated by first identifying separate streams and rhetorics of 'agile' in the literature, and AW is then situated within this typology. To understand the particular version of reality being mainstreamed by the AW rhetoric, we then examine AWs conceptualisation as 'a new way of working', as promoted by dominant actors within the UK work context. We then consider existing studies of worker experiences under different employment arrangements that can be subsumed under the heading of 'AW practices'. Our analysis highlights voids between what may be considered as mainstream HR practice when applied to standard employees compared to a spectrum of 'non-standard' workers. The implications for the role of HR in the implementation of AW and in managing the worker experience are discussed and future avenues for this under-researched area are offered.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2099226;Perceived employability of skilled migrants: a systematic review and future research agenda. This review examines the perceived employability of skilled migrants (SMs) through an analysis of 88 management and organisational research articles published over 2009-2019 period. We find the extant literature characterised by context-specific studies featuring considerable variety in terms of levels of analysis, theory, and content. Using the notion of perceived employability, key themes in the literature are identified and presented in an integrative framework. The framework encompasses individual, organisational, occupational, and institutional components of the perceived employability of SMs, different forms of work transition and associated mediators (broadening strategies) and moderators (transition conditions). Proposing adoption of process thinking for future research, suggestions regarding the interaction of individual and contextual components of perceived employability and the mediation and moderation mechanisms in the process of work transition are outlined.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2054282;Can reflection explain how empowering leadership affects spillover to family life? let me think about it complement. The present study examines a serial mediation model based on conservation of resources theory, in which empowering leadership predicts the nature of work-family interfaces via work engagement and work reflection. The examination of work reflection extends prior research on the work-family interface and allows for testing the effects of resources created in the workplace (e.g., empowering leader behaviors and work engagement) on family life. Three waves of data over a six-month time period were obtained from 274 full-time U.S. employees. Structural equation modeling and bootstrapping assessed the mediating effects of work engagement and reflection about work. The results generally supported the mediation model, but mainly for positive reflection. It showed that empowering leaders led to subordinates experiencing positive work-to-family spillover because they promoted subordinates' work engagement and positive reflection about their work experiences. Although work engagement also led to less negative work reflection, that mediator did not have additional unique effects on work-to-family spillover. Only indirect effects through engagement and positive reflection were found;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The influence of upward social comparison on the intention to work abroad among doctors in Iraq: the mediating mechanism of attitude towards leaving. The primary objective of the study was to verify the possibility that social comparisons occurred between professionals (i.e. doctors) in their country of origin to similar others in different hospitals, healthcare systems, and countries. In addition, this study also examined whether these social comparisons resulted in an intention to work abroad among these professionals who remained in their home country. On a sample of 450 Iraqi doctors, we used Structural Equation Modeling through partial least squares (PLS-SEM) to analyse the data. Our study found that upward comparison and attitude towards leaving positively affected the intention to work abroad among doctors who remained in Iraq. Further, the relationship between upward comparison and intention to work abroad was mediated by attitude towards leaving. Our study extends the brain drain literature by examining the role of social comparison, specifically upward comparison, in the migration of professionals and how such a comparison leads to intention to work abroad. The implications for theory and practices to reduce such a comparison among professionals are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1996432;Regulating HRM: the limits of regulatory pluralism. Ideas about regulatory pluralism provided an intellectual foundation for the post-1980s transformation in regulatory frameworks from predominantly state-centric regulation to a growing emphasis on the alternative regulations now abundant in HRM and IHRM. Regulatory pluralism, which maintains that a diversity of alternative regulatory institutions and tools provide more responsive, relevant and legitimate regulation than traditional state regulation, emerged alongside the political ascendancy of neoliberalism. Recent IHRM research on global supply chain regulation largely explains weaknesses in non-nation-state forms of regulation in terms of the relationships of power and commitment among stakeholders and other contextual factors. This article argues that the theory of regulatory pluralism, can contribute both to an understanding and critique of how the growing profusion of regulatory forms populating various HR functions impacts on the quality of HRM policy and practice. The article's empirical focus is on the national setting, and in particular, regulatory frameworks applying to OHS management. We argue that a pluralist mix of regulators, often overlapping and competing, is less effective in achieving policy objectives and normative change in HRM, than traditional state-oriented regulation.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Unfolding the roles of perceived green human resource management practices, dual mediation paths, and perceived environmentally-specific authentic leadership. Employee eco-initiatives can contribute to organizational green sustainability. Nonetheless, mechanisms underlying employee green creativity have not been fully understood. Our study aims to investigate if perceived green human resource management (HRM) practices can foster green creativity among employees via dual mediation paths of green crafting and harmonious environmental passion. A two-wave survey process was conducted to garner responses from 712 employees and 106 managers from tour operators operating in Vietnam. Results revealed the mediating roles of green crafting and harmonious environmental passion for the linkage between perceived green HRM practices and employee green creativity. Perceived environmentally-specific authentic leadership was unpacked as a moderator for the impacts of perceived green HRM practices on green crafting and harmonious environmental passion. By identifying these mediating and moderating effects, our inquiry advances the stream of research on the HRM-creativity linkage in the green management domain.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1919739;Human resource professionals' human and social capital in SMEs: small firm, big impact. HR professionals have been widely ignored in the Human Resource (HR) management literature pertaining to small and medium-sized enterprises (SME). Given that entrepreneurs may be reluctant to hire HR professionals, it is important to investigate the value that HR people may bring to an SME. Addressing this literature gap, our research draws on resource orchestration theory (ROT) to link the interaction between HR professionals' human and social capital to firm performance via the use of high-performance work practices (HPWPs). Further, this relationship depends on the SME's size: in small firms, the link is strengthened because HR professionals' human and social capital is more likely to create a competitive advantage in a context of resource poverty. We test the research model among a sample of 174 Canadian SMEs with fewer than 250 employees. Our results show that HR professionals' human and social capital is more closely related to firm performance through the adoption of HPWPs in small SMEs than in large ones. Overall, our study highlights the value that HR professionals bring to small SMEs and advocates for a greater presence of HR professionals in SMEs.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The European Commission will reinforce the value of adult training through an evaluation of the impact of actions. Among the existing options in evaluating the impact of actions, training transfer is crucial in determining the degree to which the learning acquired during training is used at work. We validated a predicting transfer model in the Spanish Public Administration (SPA) by analyzing, through structural equation modeling (SEM), results of the application of the Factors for Predicting Transfer (FPT) questionnaire applied after the training, and the Scale of Efficacy (CdE) applied four months after the training (n = 726). Although satisfaction and motivation to transfer were not related to transfer, content relevance and accountability were. This study widens the traditional contexts of the study of training transfer and provides valid and reliable empirical data on transfer embedded in a new context, the Spanish Public Administration. This can help further develop the field of international human resource management (IHRM) by exploring transfer in different cultural contexts.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2385400;Employee reactions to perceived 'non-talent' designation: a social comparison perspective. Talent designation is one of the most sensitive and controversial topics in talent management. As organisations adopt workforce differentiation practices, a subset of employees is often considered 'talent', while other employees may implicitly perceive 'non-talent' status. Taking a social comparison perspective, we examine under which conditions employees are more likely to respond positively or negatively to perceived non-talent designation. Specifically, we draw on research on personal goals and extend the self-evaluation maintenance model. We argue that, contrary to common assumptions, perceived non-talent designation may not universally cause negative responses. Comparison can be experienced as inspiration or envy - depending on the relevance of talent status to one's identity, attainability of talent status in the future, and a multitude of micro-, meso-, and macro-level contextual factors. This, in turn, shapes both employees' approach motivation to gain talent status and self-serving attributions to defend non-talent status. In doing so, we provide a more nuanced understanding of employee reactions to perceived non-talent designation and highlight the value of dynamic talent designation in organisations.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2354837;Evaluating performance in the context of mobile telework: an attention-based view. This study is an empirical account of how line managers evaluate the performance of their subordinates in the context of mobile telework. Whilst the increasing use of new technologies affords certain advantages for line managers in remote performance evaluation (PE), it also results in a greater volume, fragmentation and variety of performance data, which can be challenging to manage. Adopting an attention-based view (ABV), we shed light on the role of technology in PE, elaborating on the kinds of attentional stimuli that are generated by technology as part of the broader socio-technical work environment, and how these together with the attentional perspectives of the manager influence attentional engagement, i.e. what managers direct their time, energy and effort on in PE. Our focus is on attention as something line managers do, in their immediate context. We contribute to the remote work and PE literature by showing how the interplay between two drivers of attentional engagement: attentional stimuli (different possible foci of attention in the external environment) and managers' own attentional perspectives (the cognitive and motivational structures that influence what stimuli receive attention) influence the attentional engagement in PE of mobile teleworkers.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper problematizes micro-level conceptualizations of extreme work to develop new research directions. The paper shows how frontline healthcare workers interpret and articulate ideas about doing extreme work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two interconnected themes are discussed: a narrative of professional opportunity, related to identifying the extreme context as a space of opportunity to re-shape understandings about their professional purpose and gain professional legitimacy, and a narrative of occupational heroism, related to a way of doing extreme work that focuses on establishing dependable relational dynamics and working extremely as a means to become indispensable. The article reinforces the importance of the situated understanding of work settings and suggests a research agenda that can help to inform HRM policies and practices to manage and develop specific groups of professionals.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This article reviews the body of empirical work on human resource management in times of crisis, including that which was conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and that which has been published since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following this, we introduce the special issue, summarizing the six articles included. Finally, we present a comprehensive agenda for future research on how to manage human resources during times of crisis based on the insights from the review and our own knowledge of the literature.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2180652;The impact of discretionary HR practices on knowledge sharing and intention to quit - a three-wave study on the role of career satisfaction, organizational identification, and work engagement. While it is known that high-quality human resource management (HRM) contributes to organizational performance, the process through which individual outcomes are influenced is understudied. Further, not all HRM practices are similarly influential in making impact on performance. We introduce and empirically test a theoretical model that explores the mechanism through which discretionary HRM practices influence employees' attitudes and behaviors. Employing a three-wave dataset collected from full-time employees (478 employees in Time 1, 266 employees in Time 2, and 235 employees in Time 3), we identify the mediating role of career satisfaction and organizational identification and the moderating role of work engagement as relevant factors in the relationship between perceived discretionary HRM practices and employees' knowledge sharing behavior and turnover intentions. The analysis, based on Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), has validated the proposed model. The theoretical contribution we offer expands the understanding of role of HRM in shaping work behaviors and outcomes. The study identifies the unique impact of perceived discretionary HR practices on individual and organizational factors, in particular, the important issue of knowledge sharing. The major added value we bring to the literature is about the relevance and impact of discretionary HR practices and the implications it offers to HRM and line managers. Using the findings, organizations can tailor HRM system to fit their position and characteristics and develop 'best practice' to fit their needs.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2131457;Imprinting in HR process research: a systematic review and integrative conceptual model. Human resource (HR) process research refers to the way HR practices are communicated in organisations, including the way these HR practices are understood (i.e. perceived HR strength) and attributed (i.e. HR attributions) by employees. Previous research has mainly focused on the outcomes of the HR process, while research that examines both antecedents and employee outcomes is relatively rare. This is especially the case for imprinting factors, defined as the hereditary and family-related influences, non-work contextual factors, and cultural values that may affect the way employees understand and attribute HR in their organisation. To further explore this relatively new area of research, this paper provides a systematic review of 19 empirical studies that investigate the role of imprinting factors in HR process research. Through the application of an imprinting framework with HR content and HR process theories, this review is orientated around the development of an integrative conceptual framework that elaborates on how, when, and to what degree imprinting factors influence the effect of bundles of HR practices on perceived HR strength and HR attributions and, as a consequence, employee outcomes. We conclude our review with several research directions that act as a platform for future scholarship.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2086438;Civilian volunteers in United Nations hot spots: what makes them intend to apply for yet another mission?. This study focused on United Nations (UN) civilian volunteers serving in hot spots, and tested a model to predict their intentions to apply for a new UN assignment. These individuals have characteristics of both assigned expatriates and self-initiated expatriates. In-Role Behaviours (IRB) and Organizational Citizenship Behaviours towards the Local Population (OCB-Locals) were related to sense of personal accomplishment, that in turn was related to intentions to apply for another UN assignment. Sense of personal accomplishment played a mediating role. Both the personality trait of agreeableness and the attitudinal factor of commitment towards the local population were predictive of IRB, but only agreeableness was predictive of OCB-Locals. Moderation effects were identified, but the direction of most of them was unexpected. For example, it was low openness to experience that strengthened the link between sense of personal accomplishment and intentions to re-apply. The study's implications for expatriation research and for practice are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2054284;Perceived organizational support and task performance of employees with disabilities: a need satisfaction and social identity perspectives. In this article, we combine insights from basic psychological needs theory and the social identity approach to propose that perceptions of organizational support enhance the basic need satisfaction of employees with disabilities, which yields higher levels of task performance. We also suggest that disability group identification strengthens this mediational process. We tested our hypotheses with two quantitative field studies that were conducted in France and based on matched employee-supervisor data. Using a sample of employees working in companies that specialize in the employment of persons with disabilities, Study 1 aimed to provide initial evidence for the mediating role of basic need satisfaction. Study 2 aimed to replicate the findings of Study 1 in less specific contexts while testing the moderating role of disability group identification. Next, the methodological limitations of these investigations were addressed in two quantitative post hoc studies. The results of these studies support our model and generate new knowledge about whether, why and when the perception of favorable treatment contributes to the job performance of employees with disabilities. We also discuss the practical implications of our findings and provide suggestions for human resources managers.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2054285;HRM work and open innovation: evidence from a case study. This paper proposes a framework for firm use of HRM when engaging in open innovation. Whereas open innovation has gained wide recognition in the innovation management field, as firms open their boundaries to knowledge inflow and outflow to advance innovation, very few empirical papers link the HRM literature to this phenomenon. We base our analysis on an exploratory qualitative study of the pharmaceutical corporation AstraZeneca and its implementation of an open innovation initiative called BioVentureHub. We identify three main areas of HRM work: inbound, outbound, and coupled HRM work. Furthermore, we illustrate how these HRM activities relate to the development of the open innovation initiative and to current HRM and open innovation literature. The framework identifies HRM activities that target not only internal employees, but also external human resources engaged in the open innovation initiative. This HRM work is mainly conducted through informal means, separate from the host corporation's business as usual. Our empirical study contributes to the limited and mainly conceptual research connecting open innovation with HRM, increasing our knowledge of how corporations use HRM work to manage open innovation initiatives in practice.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1949374;From brain drain to brain gain: the agenda for talent management in overcoming talent migration from emerging markets. Within the macro talent management (MTM) framework, exogenous challenges caused by the complexity of the external environment are being actively discussed. Considering these challenges, among which is talent mobility, the paper investigates the factors that determine migration intentions of talents and discusses the role of firm-level talent management (TM) practices in addressing those factors, reversing brain drain, and managing talent flows. Using primary data from 557 talented graduates from leading Russian universities we found that the influence of industry- and individual-level factors, which determine their intentions to move abroad, may be mitigated by talent attraction, talent development and talent retention practices. The findings imply the moderating role of TM in managing country-level talent migration. Our study contributes to and extends the TM literature by providing evidence from the individual-level perspective, which firm-level TM initiatives may serve as a mechanism for human capital accumulation and retention, and for improving the national-level MTM system.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1943491;Paving the way for progress in employee agility research: a systematic literature review and framework. Troubled by increasing uncertainty in the business environment, many organizations have a strong need to become agile. There are indications that agility-oriented characteristics of employees, often referred to as workforce agility, play a key role in this regard. This paper systematically reviews the academic literature on employee agility, with an emphasis on conceptualization, operationalization, and the special role of human resource management (HRM) in shaping it. Our study finds that construct clarity, theoretical foundation, and rigor in operationalization are not yet well established, and that the role of HRM is under-researched. In order to pave the way for future research, we clarify the understanding of the employee agility concept and suggest a new definition resulting from our theoretical discussion. We embed this conceptualization in a newly suggested framework which is rooted in the work stressor framework. It links employee agility to the job demands of a dynamic environment, and outlines the role of flexibility-promoting HR practices. As such, we explicitly refer to a dynamic lens on person-environment (P-E) fit theory. Furthermore, through the suggested conceptualization of employee agility and the theory-based framework, we amplify existing theory. Based on our findings, we draw up an encompassing agenda for future research.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2019.1579251;Recruitment discrimination: how organizations use social power to circumvent laws and regulations. This study focuses on the relationships between social power and recruitment discrimination in organizations. We examine how individuals in different hierarchical positions in organizations in France intentionally discriminate in their recruitment practices through various means of circumventing internal and external anti-discrimination policies. Social power theory is used as a theoretical framework.Twenty-eight semi-structured in-depth interviews with individuals involved in recruitment in France were conducted, transcribed and analyzed.The findings reveal two distinct strategies used to intentionally discriminate in recruitment. One strategy concentrates on outsourcing recruitment actions. In doing so, organizations can effectively divert the responsibility of upholding anti-discrimination rules and regulations to an outside party. In this strategy, the use of unwritten codes and external pressure (or the threat thereof) are employed so that the outside recruitment agency understands that it is to follow the client's wishes over the law, which relates to coercive power. The second strategy focuses on conducting covertly controlled in-house recruitment through the use of differential and legitimate power to overrule decisions, make use of vague and complex laws, or use costs and administrative difficulties as potential business reasons which may permit discrimination.We add to a growing body of research on recruitment discrimination and power.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This article aims to inspire international human resource management (IHRM) scholarship that incorporates postcolonial feminist theory, using the under-researched topic of paternalistic leadership and gender to illustrate the opportunities and challenges such an endeavour can present. Paternalistic leadership is an important and widely used indigenous framework for examining leadership in Chinese contexts, while postcolonial feminism holds the capacity to problematise the representation of non-western women in feminist theory as a universal, transhistorical category. As this article demonstrates, postcolonial feminist theory centralises cultural difference in theorising gender, strives toward shattering binaries reproduced by colonialism and imperialism (West/East, Western/Third World Woman) and generates indigenous, localised knowledge on non-western women. Three sites of enquiry are discussed: 1) Chinese feminisms and genders;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Research on the field of creativity currently lacks a cumulative investigation of how and why emotional stability affects individuals' creative processes and performance in the workplace. The present study investigates the mediating and moderating processes through which emotional stability is linked with creativity. We examine the indirect effects of emotional stability on creativity through daily positive affect and daily work engagement, and further test whether paradoxical leadership moderates these relationships. Data were collected from 111 employees in Korea who took surveys in four different phases-Time 1, Time 2, Time 3 (i.e. daily surveys for 10 consecutive workdays), and Time 4. The results show that daily work engagement mediates the relationship between emotional stability and creativity, while the direct effect of emotional stability on creativity and the mediating role of daily positive affect in this relationship are not supported. Furthermore, paradoxical leadership was found to moderate the indirect effects of emotional stability on creativity via daily positive affect and daily work engagement, with significant indirect effects when paradoxical leadership was high but not when it was low. Important theoretical and practical implications to the extant literature on creativity and leadership are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) of MNE subsidiaries in emerging markets has mainly been studied through aggregated CSR activities. Instead, this study disaggregates CSR engagement towards target groups into two foci - External and Internal CSR - depending on whether such engagement is outside or within the organization. We explored whether the odds of a wholly owned subsidiary matching its parent's choice of target groups - for both External and Internal CSR - varied by which organizational cohort it belonged to, based on organizational characteristics. Results of logistic regressions indicate that age of a subsidiary, relative size of the subsidiary and region-of-origin of its parent influence the odds of the subsidiary following its parent's External CSR focus;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2429125;Fueling creativity: HR practices, work engagement, personality, and autonomy. Although creativity is an important domain of performance in turbulent environments, little research has examined through which underlying mediating mechanism and when HR practices are effective in facilitating creative task performance. Building on the conservation of resources theory, we aimed to (1) investigate whether opportunity-enhancing HR practices were positively linked to employee creativity through work engagement and (2) examine the roles of two new boundary conditions (i.e. proactive personality and work autonomy) in these relationships. To test our predictions, a sample of 282 Dutch employees was surveyed using a three-wave lagged survey design. The findings obtained from regression-based path analyses demonstrated that, as expected, work engagement served as a mediator between HR practices and creativity. Moreover, the results indicated that a proactive personality was found to amplify the positive association between HR practices and work engagement. Additionally, work autonomy was found to amplify both the positive association between work engagement and creativity, as well as the indirect association between HR practices and creativity mediated by work engagement. These findings reveal that organizations can enhance employees' creative performance by implementing HR practices that empower and involve employees, while simultaneously cultivating work engagement, proactive personality traits, and autonomy in the workplace.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2429128;Managing boundaries: exploring the experiences of line-managers who provide mental health support in the workplace. The increase in mental ill-health amongst the working population presents a serious challenge for organisations. Line-managers are an important provider of support to staff with psychological distress (PD), their experiences however, are under-researched. In response, we interviewed 15 line-managers from the private, public, and voluntary sector about their support provision to subordinates with PD. Drawing upon workplace social support and boundary management theory we explored line-manager confidence, boundaries of the manager/subordinate relationship, and how they navigate the competing demands of their role. We found that organisational psychosocial climate and context are key factors: a stressful or demanding working environment, and/or unsupportive colleagues can undermine the capacity of line-managers to provide social support. Theoretical contributions include focusing on the provider, rather than recipient, of social support and integrating social support and boundary management theory. Practical recommendations include removing the onus on line-managers to provide support and advocating shared organisational responsibility for support from multiple sources, underpinned by a wider remit of policies and procedures. This paper includes line-manager narratives around employee mental ill-health including reference to suicide, that some readers may find distressing.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2391946;The interaction effect between role overload and skill training on older workers' work engagement: the mediating role of job crafting. As the modern workforce is increasingly aging and age-diverse, helping older workers maintain a positive state at work is theoretically and practically imperative. Due to the heterogeneity of individuals' aging trajectories, self-initiated job crafting may be a more effective approach for older workers to manage their roles. However, limited research has addressed this critical issue systematically. Drawing on the job demands-resources model and conservation of resources theory, we examine whether role overload, skill training, and their joint effect influence older workers' job crafting behaviors, which, in turn, increase their work engagement. Our results from a multi-wave study provide support for the significant influence of role overload, skill training, and their joint effect. Specifically, role overload facilitated older workers' negative crafting behaviors (i.e., reducing demands), and skill training stimulated their positive crafting behaviors (i.e., seeking resources and seeking challenges). The results of the interaction between role overload and skill training indicated that when older workers have access to adequate skill training, role overload positively influences seeking resources and seeking challenges, and negatively influences reducing demands. Furthermore, the interaction between role overload and skill training influenced older workers' work engagement through seeking resources and seeking challenges.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2325562;Co-workers' perceptions of the distributive justice of idiosyncratic deals - the roles of content, timing, and justice sensitivity. Research to date creates a predominantly positive image of idiosyncratic deals (i-deals). However, since i-deals lead to differences in employment relationships, they can trigger perceptions of unfairness and negative reactions among co-workers, thereby posing a threat to the overall effectiveness of i-deals. Against this background, it is important to gain more insights into how co-workers' perceptions of distributive justice are shaped. Building on distributive justice theory and integrating distributive justice principles with the roles of emotions and personality, this study investigates three factors that are likely to influence co-workers' perceptions of the distributive justice of an i-deal: the i-deal's content, the negotiation's timing, and co-workers' justice sensitivity. The results of the vignette-based, between-subjects quasi-experimental study with 650 employees show that these three factors influence co-workers' perceptions of an i-deal's distributive justice. In addition, the results of the study reveal interaction effects between the factors under investigation. By examining what influences co-workers' perceptions of distributive justice, this study contributes to a better understanding of i-deals from a third-party perspective and highlights that some types of i-deals, in terms of content and timing, should be approached with particular caution by supervisors.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This study examines the configuration of international HRM strategies to understand how an MNE pursues global integration and local responsiveness simultaneously in HRM. Drawing upon cases of eight South Korean and Japanese MNEs, we identify different patterns of configuration of five international HRM strategies that shape distinct sets of activities. We show that the firms pursue global integration and local responsiveness simultaneously, but in distinct ways, by configuring international HRM strategies for both integration and responsiveness rather than solely just relying on either one. Our findings offer insight into how MNEs actually manage the duality of global integration and local responsiveness at the strategy level beyond the hybridization of global standardization and localization of practices.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2317726;The interplay of multicultural and career identity development. Career identity development, involving exploration and commitment, is a lifelong process by an individual that is fundamental to shaping one's career. Although prior research has investigated what may lead one to develop a strong and clear career identity, there is limited understanding of the cultural influences on career identity development relevant to multicultural individuals. Integrating the identity status paradigm with a narrative identity perspective, we propose that career identity development interplays with multicultural identity development. We explore this interplay through in-depth interviews with Chinese-ethnic multicultural individuals. From the interviews, we elucidate a typology (Multicultural-Career Identity Interplay, 'MCII') to explain how multicultural identity and career identity development are interrelated in systematic ways (Commanding, Cruising, and Contending), and introduce a dual-dimensional, relational-oriented framework of career paths. We explain how each MCII pattern corresponds to individual career paths and is associated with immigration age. Our study extends career identity development theory into the cultural identity domain, providing a more nuanced understanding of the dynamic and culturally influenced career development of multicultural individuals. The findings can help individuals and career counsellors better understand and support the career identity development of individuals who identify with more than one culture.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2237880;How does CEO social class perception impact employee-related CSR? Evidence from privately owned Chinese firms. Despite recent progress, the literature is still unclear on the internal determinants of employee-related corporate social responsibility (CSR), particularly regarding the effect of the chief executive officer (CEO). Integrating upper echelons theory with the social class literature, this study examines how CEO social class perception influences private firms' employee-related CSR. Based on a unique dataset from the Nationwide Private Firms Survey of China, this study empirically shows that higher CEO social class perception promotes a higher level of employee-related CSR activities in private firms. Additionally, this positive impact of CEO social class perception on employee-related CSR is amplified among younger firms and firms that face higher market munificence. Our study contributes to the current literature by enriching our understanding of the antecedents of employee-related CSR from the perspective of the CEO's cognition of his or her social class and revealing the related informative boundary conditions.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2227769;The cost of guilt: unpacking the emotional mechanism between work-to-family conflict and unethical pro-family behavior. Drawing on the appraisal theory of emotions and domain specificity perspective, we explore why and when work-to-family conflict leads to unethical pro-family behavior in the workplace. In particular, we propose that work-to-family conflict reinforces unethical pro-family behavior via employee felt guilt. Further, supervisor support for family issues attenuates the relationship between work-to-family conflict and felt guilt, whereas perceived forgiveness climate strengthens the relationship between felt guilt and unethical pro-family behavior. Two time-lagged field studies conducted in Pakistan and China supported our hypotheses. Study 1 demonstrated that work-to-family guilt mediated the relationship between work-to-family conflict and unethical pro-family behavior. Study 2 replicated these findings and provided additional support for our boundary conditions. Specifically, supervisor support for family issues buffered the positive effect of work-to-family conflict on work-to-family guilt;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2192358;Socially responsible human resource management and employee green behavior at work: the role of learning goal orientation and moral identity. Drawing on self-regulation theory, we developed and tested a model to investigate the positive correlation between socially responsible human resource management (SRHRM) and employee workplace green behavior (WGB). We tested and found support for our theoretical model using multi-wave studies within one organization and across multiple organizations. Based on a sample of 261 employees from a food chain company (Study 1) and 259 employees from 43 organizations (Study 2), we identified a direct relationship between SRHRM and employee WGB and an indirect relationship mediated by learning goal orientation and moral identity. Additionally, coworker support moderated the effects of SRHRM on learning goal orientation and moral identity. These conclusions provide a new entry point for exploring why SRHRM affects employee WGB.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2151846;Virtual interaction and failure learning-The crucial role of team LMX composition. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of virtual work. Enabled by the pandemic, the present study addresses the consequences of virtual interaction among regular work teams. Building on and expanding prior research, we develop lines of reasoning to suggest that virtuality negatively affects team failure learning. Additionally, we argue that team LMX quality and team LMX differentiation can help mitigate this effect. We test our hypotheses based on survey data from 73 teams working for a service unit at an international bank. In line with our theorizing, the results reveal that virtuality hampers team failure learning. Moreover, we find that team LMX quality and team LMX differentiation can serve to alleviate the negative consequences of virtuality. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our study to support HR managers and propose some areas for future research.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2148551;Bringing it all back home: the HRM role in workforce localisation in MNEs in Saudi Arabia. Governments across the Arabian Gulf aim to reduce their dependence on expatriates by implementing localisation policies. Building on institutional and legitimacy theories, we seek to advance our understanding of the effects of such policies on multinational enterprises (MNEs). We used data from 157 MNEs operating in Saudi Arabia and found the indigenisation of the human resource management (HRM) function is closely correlated with the level of workforce localisation: key factors empowering localisation, defined as recruitment and training practices geared towards the needs of locals, include the demographics and role of the HRM Director. Theoretically, we contribute to the literature on institutionalism and legitimacy by revealing how various institutional forces influence the process of selection and transfer of HRM practices to adapt to the institutional environment of a given context. Our research also shows that if MNEs follow government recommendations, develop links with local educational institutions to target suitable job candidates, and adapt to shortages in local skills and competencies by investing in the training and development of local workers, they will be more likely to achieve success in workforce localisation and legitimacy.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2112259;What makes telework work? Evidence of success factors across two decades of empirical research: a systematic and critical review. Advances in information and communications technology have contributed to the spread of telework, which has been underway since the early 2000s. During the COVID-19 pandemic, telework became more than just an alternative to the traditional office: it became a strategic means of survival for many companies. Given its importance, in the last two decades, the scientific community has shown increased interest in the factors that affect successful telework. However, knowledge on this subject remains fragmented and disparate. This study aims to synthesise the literature on successful telework and consolidate its success factors into a framework that provides conceptual and holistic knowledge on the topic. Our findings demonstrate that telework is affected by factors categorised into five groups: technological materials, non-technological materials, teleworkers, teleworker work environment and teleworker family environment. A number of these factors has causal links, while some have become irrelevant and given way to new factors over time. Some have been confirmed to have an overall positive effect on telework. In addition to proposing a theoretical perspective and future research avenues, this study presents some HRM implications to help managers and policymakers make telework more effective.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1949373;Psychosocial safety climate as a mediator between high-performance work practices and service recovery performance: an international study in the airline industry. Responding to calls for further investigation of the HRM 'black box', our paper examines how psychosocial safety climate (PSC), an important but understudied form of organizational climate, mediates the relationship between ability, motivation and opportunity (AMO)-enhancing HPWPs and service recovery performance (SRP). We conducted a quantitative survey amongst flight attendants in Canada, Germany and France, which yielded 1664 valid answers. Using AMOS software V.24, the structural equation method was used to test our model. The method of Monte Carlo (parametric bootstrap) and more precisely bias corrected percentile method was used to test the mediation mechanism, based on 5,000 bootstrapping and 95% confidence intervals. Our results show that each AMO-enhancing HR bundle directly influences PSC and indirectly influences SRP via PSC. They also reveal a direct relationship between PSC and SRP.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2018.1526201;Strategizing personality traits: an acculturation approach to person-environment fit and expatriate adjustment. Models of expatriate adjustment grounded in person-environment fit theory argue expatriate adjustment occurs when the expatriate's abilities meet the demands of the cultural context and when the cultural context fulfils the expatriate's needs. However, the process of how an expatriate's abilities match the demands of the cultural context and how the expatriate's needs interact with these demands is less explored. Addressing this gap, we take an acculturation approach to build on the premise of person-environment fit theory by presenting a conceptual model that shows how an expatriate's ability to draw upon certain personality traits may influence the adoption of certain acculturation strategies needed to meet the demands of the cultural context across life domains. In this sense, an expatriate is able to meet the demands of his/her cultural context across life domains by adopting certain acculturation strategies. Moreover, we posit the importance of an expatriate's needs as represented by his/her acculturation attitudes with these demands. We contribute to the expatriate literature by extending the premise of person-environment fit theory in expatriate adjustment and by connecting personality traits with an expatriate's acculturation strategies.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2018.1523214;Self-directed career management and mobility: the risk of lock-in effects from person-job fit. Autonomy and fit with the job are important reasons why employees thrive at work, yet surprisingly little research has examined the implications this may have on how employees perceive their career opportunities, both within and outside the organization where they currently work. Drawing on self-determination theory, we propose that the more employees manage their career in a self-directed manner, the more likely they are to consider themselves to have good career opportunities both within and outside their current organization. However, we propose that, while good person-job fit may push an employee to see increasing opportunities within their current organization, it is equally likely to make the employee less inclined to see opportunities for career advancement outside the organization. Analyses on data gathered from a sample of 902 knowledge workers support our model. We conclude that person-job fit strongly influences the degree to which employees perceive opportunities for internal and external career mobility. The results have implications for research on self-directed career management, person-job fit, and the dynamics of the career mobility issue.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1886153;You can't always get what you want: mechanisms and consequences of intra-organizational job change among middle managers in Sweden. An intra-organizational change process involving all middle managers was studied in a public sector organization in Sweden over three time points, spanning two years in total. Using sensemaking and the person-environmental fit literature as well studies on promotion and demotion, hypotheses about the effects of managerial status loss and being offered a non-preferred role (non-preference) on change reactions (job satisfaction, turnover intentions, mental health) are made. Data from 140 middle managers was analyzed with path models, where two process factors (perceived organizational support during the change, procedural justice of the change) and two job characteristics (job demand, job control) were tested simultaneously as mediators. Results revealed that managerial status loss had negative effects on work attitudes but mental health was positively affected over time through decreased job demands. Non-preference had negative consequences for all outcome variables and these effects were mediated through lower procedural justice of the change, lower job control, and for some outcomes, lower perceived organizational support during the change. The results provide insight into how middle managers react to change, and suggest that process justice and job characteristics play an important part in shaping these reactions.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1080/09585192.2021.1875495;Entrepreneurial intentions and high-status seeking in career expectations: a portrait of talents in emerging countries. Nowadays organizations are increasingly engaged in talent management, because it allows firms to grow rapidly by leveraging on human capital. Most antecedent studies focused on expectations and motivations of talents living in developed countries. Though, a little is known about career expectations of talents in emerging economies, and whether they diverge from those of developed countries or not. However, this information might be of use for several motives. First, emerging countries have a high growth rate. Second, these talents may be effectively harnessed from domestic and non-domestic firms, depending on whether their expectations are met or not. Consistently, this study aims at exploring the career expectations of individuals in emerging countries, by capturing the heterogeneity of expectations between emerging and developed countries due to cultural, politic, economic, and religious differences. As a matter of fact, emerging countries are frequently characterized by low levels of both income and employment, differently from many developed countries. For such motives and because of the absence of valid employment alternatives, talents might be more willing to engage in entrepreneurial initiatives rather than attempting to be employed in an organization. Thus, the primary intent of this explorative study is to understand what are the factors that affect career expectations of talents in emerging countries. Consistently, a cross-sectional principal component analysis (PCA) was used for hypotheses testing. The sample refers to a set of African countries, based on data availability for 2019. Data used for the analysis are drawn from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) and they refer to individual entrepreneurial behaviours and attitudes. Notably, findings show that career expectations of talents are driven by motivation and opportunity, especially in the male groups. However, the study also originally shows that the need for achievement and the willingness to stand out are the main drivers of talents' expectations. In a nutshell, talents may prefer independence over the employment status. Implications of the findings, at a business level, suggest that companies in emerging markets should revisit their talent management strategy in order to avoid the loss of many talented employees. As instance, they should grant more independence, raise the income, and favour internal and female entrepreneurship. Thereby, the original findings of the study contribute both theoretically and practically to the research domain by specifying that career needs of talented people vary according to context and time.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2421345;Seen but not heard: the voice of women at work and the mediating role of culture. While there is now an extensive body of literature on employee voice behaviour in the global North, research evidence from the global South is limited. This has constrained our understanding of the barriers that female workers face in expressing their views and concerns in developing countries such as Nigeria. This article examines the cultural factors that shape female employee voice behaviour in Nigerian workplaces. Using a meta-synthesis of 52 semi-structured interviews and approximately 200 h of non-participant observation, we identify a high-power distance orientation and patriarchal norms as two cultural factors that contribute to gender imbalance in the workplace, making it difficult for female employees to express their opinions, suggestions, ideas, or complaints about important workplace issues. Our findings highlight a system of patriarchal hegemony and gender inequality that makes voice behaviour difficult for female workers. The findings also show that contextualised religious norms and teachings encourage silence among female employees. We provide valuable insights into the cultural norms that inhibit female employee voice behaviour in the Global South context.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2421343;Benevolent authoritarianism, paternalism and religious humanitarianism in Sri Lanka: a dependent or autonomous HR?. This article examines the cases of five Sri Lankan export-oriented companies, each situated within global production networks (GPN) with British companies at the apex. In examining their managerial practices, a strong similarity to the practices associated with Anglo-Saxon paternalism is identified. However, these observed parallels are a product of local circumstances and the particular location within the GPN rather than a consequence of any emulation of British practices. The resulting system reflects a high power-dependency relationship that employers hold over employees. In this sense, the emergent HR system is partly dependent on the position in the GPN and partly autonomous. The system is characterised by a gendered division of labour and by the proximity of managerial oversight over the issue of worker autonomy. The factory setting has lower levels of worker autonomy and dependency compared to tea harvesting. One outlying exception to the general paternalistic approach, in one of the companies studied, is where the religious and ethnic makeup of the workforce is not shared with management, leading to increased conflict with the unionised workforce. The nature of Sri Lankan paternalism is specific and endogenous, but the conditions creating this paternalism are likely to be replicated elsewhere.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2199939;A conceptual cross-disciplinary model of organizational practices for older workers: multilevel antecedents and outcomes. Due to population aging and its implications for organizations and societies, organizational practices for older workers (OPOWs) play a relevant role in multiple research disciplines. So far, most reviews on this topic operationalize organizational practices as antecedents of older workers' outcomes. We extend this perspective by illustrating multilevel antecedents and outcomes of OPOWs. In doing so, we demonstrate how these organizational practices directly and indirectly affect older workers, organizations, and society and how, in turn, older workers, organizations and society impact OPOWs. Drawing on a literature review, we discuss key theories and present current empirical findings from multiple research disciplines to propose an integrated cross-disciplinary model with the potential to guide future research and practice.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2167522;How emotional labor harms employee's performance: unleashing the missing links through anxiety, quality of work-life and Islamic work ethic. Employing conservation of resources (COR) theory, this research examined how emotional labor influences employees' job performance by testing a serial mediation moderation model. We propose job anxiety and quality of work-life (QoWL) as explanatory mechanisms in the emotional labor-job performance relationship, and Islamic work ethic as a coping mechanism between job-related anxiety and quality of work-life. To test our proposed hypotheses, the data was collected from 211 service sector supervisor-subordinate dyads in a three waved time-lagged study. Results elaborate that service employees who suffer from resource depletion due to emotional labor and job-related anxiety can still enjoy a better quality of work-life and deliver well at their workplace when they possess a stronger Islamic work ethic.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Researchers and practitioners are becoming increasingly concerned with the consequences of modern work arrangements for our understanding of work. This article, alongside the four papers which are included in the special issue, explores the implications of new ways of working for employees. We conceptualise new ways of working as an ongoing transformative process, characterised by unprecedented spread, speed and depth of transformation, and highlight four major changes in work which impact employees' experiences. We critically evaluate the implications of each change for employees' attitudes, performance and wellbeing, and suggest areas where more research is needed to deepen our knowledge about how modern work arrangements affect employees.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2133574;Accessing and sustaining work after Service: the role of Active Labour Market Policies (ALMP) and implications for HRM. This article considers the extent to which Active Labour Market Policies (ALMPs) support the sustained inclusion of veterans in the civilian labour market. Drawing on the first in-depth research into veteran's interactions with the UK's Public Employment Services (PES) and other contracted providers, we present analysis of qualitative longitudinal data from 68 veterans. We demonstrate the important role ALMPs play in mediating the employment relationship, showing how veterans claiming out-of-work benefits are typically either 'pushed' towards inappropriate jobs or 'parked' through their exclusion from employment support when deemed unfit for work. This not only exposes veterans and other jobseekers to poor quality work but undermines both job match and inclusive employment practices. Furthermore, the potential for more positive outcomes through engagement with employers and HRM practitioners is not being realised. This is significant for veterans in the UK and beyond, where policymakers make broader commitments to post-Service integration into civilian employment. We critique Work First approaches centred on those deemed work ready and contribute to broader theorisation around interactions between the state and HRM, arguing the need for pluralist approaches which incorporate ALMPs.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2137424;Interactional justice and cognitive rumination explain effects of empowering leadership on home life. Based on conservation of resources theory, the present study examines a serial mediation model in which empowering leadership predicts the nature of work-home interfaces via cognitive states and processes (interactional justice and work rumination). Two waves of data with a one-month interval were obtained from 195 full-time Korean employees. Structural equation modeling assessed mediation, first by two forms of interactional justice (interpersonal and informational) and then by two forms of work rumination (positive and negative). The results generally supported the mediation model showing that empowering leaders helped subordinates' work-home enrichment, because they enhanced both interpersonal and informational justice, resulting in positive rumination about their work experiences. Empowering leaders also helped reduce subordinates' work-home conflict through enhancing informational justice, which made employees ruminate less about negative aspects of work during off-job time. Testing alternative models that added more direct paths did not improve model fit. Overall, the study contributed to understanding the underlying cognitive mechanisms explaining the effect of empowering leadership on work-home spillover.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

An increasing volume of research has examined issues related to working abroad, but studies focusing on low-skilled migrant workers are lagging. Relying on intercultural interaction and social exchange views as overarching frames, we examined determinants of low-skilled immigrant workers' workplace satisfaction. With a sample of 640 migrant workers from eight countries, we specifically examined and compared the effects of cultural and workplace factors. Results showed that intercultural negativity factors such as intercultural rejection sensitivity and intercultural interaction difficulty reduced the workplace satisfaction of low-skilled migrant workers, while social exchange factors such as supervisory support and distributive justice perception boosted their workplace satisfaction. We further found that workplace factors showed significantly stronger effects than cultural factors on their workplace satisfaction. Finally, we examined interaction effects between cultural and workplace factors, and found that the positive effect of supervisory support was greater for those who perceived more cultural difficulty than for those perceiving less cultural difficulty. Theoretical and practical implications are included.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While there is evidence that high-investment human resource system (HIHRS) use is related to positive behavioral outcomes, our understanding of the underlying mechanism is wanting. Answering the calls for more cross-level human resource management (HRM) studies, we integrate and build on contemporary organizational justice climate research and the extant cross-level HRM research to investigate unit justice climates as novel mechanisms through which unit HIHRS use may advance the performance of units and their members. Adopting a multi-level and multi-source approach, we develop and test a moderated mediation model to explain how unit-level HIHRS use relates to unit and individual task performance. Analysis of multi-source data from 701 managers, 120 food and beverage units and 40 hotel properties of a multinational hotel chain illuminated the mediating influence of unit overall justice climates on the relationships between unit HIHRS use and unit and individual task performance. Moreover, unit procedural and distributive justice climates were found to have positive interactive effects on that performance. The current study's findings, practical implications, limitations, and avenues for future research are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1996433;The role of human resource practices for including persons with disabilities in the workforce: a systematic literature review. Organizations are increasingly aware that a better vocational inclusion of persons with disabilities (PWD) is in their self-interest for reasons such as a shortage of skilled labor, an increasing prevalence of disability in their aging workforces, and changed societal attitudes and laws regarding the promotion of diversity and equity in the workplace. Human resource (HR) practices have been identified as a primary enabler of inclusion, yet research on disability-related HR Management is scattered across disciplines. To provide an evidence-based analysis and integration, this article systematically reviews the literature on HR management in the context of employing persons with disabilities, using the high-performance work practices 'selection and staffing', 'training and development', '(performance) appraisal, promotion, and career management' and 'compensation and benefits' as an organizing framework. We systematically reviewed and summarized the key findings of 74 empirical studies conducted from 1990 through 2020. Most studies focused on selection and staffing practices, providing strong evidence that standardization and structure reduce bias in the appraisal of PWD and related employment decisions. Research regarding appropriate HR practices that allow to utilize, develop and reward PWDs' potential, in contrast, is still in its infancy.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1953564;Flexibility I-deals and prosocial motives: a trickle-down perspective. Growing concerns of maintaining the best talent have contributed to the rising number of idiosyncratic deals (i-deals) at the workplace. I-deals refer to the personalised work arrangements between employees and their employers where the terms benefit both parties. Despite the acknowledgment that supervisors are key in creating i-deals, research to date has overlooked their role. Drawing on prosocial motives and social learning theory, we explore an overall model of what triggers employee flexibility i-deals and the consequences of such i-deals on employee outcomes. In so doing, we explore one of the key yet untested assumptions of i-deals theory: that they are intended to be mutually beneficial. We investigate our model with matched supervisor - employee data (n = 186) collected in El Salvador and Chile. Findings reveal that there is a positive association between supervisors' prosocial motives and employees' flexibility i-deals. Moreover, prosocial motives of supervisors trickle-down and shape employees' functioning at work (i.e. work performance and deviant behaviours) and lead them to be more prosocially motivated through employees' flexibility i-deals.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1937672;Trapped in a loss spiral: how and when work alienation relates to knowledge hiding. Drawing on conservation of resources theory, we hypothesize that work alienation promotes knowledge hiding through emotional exhaustion and that job mobility moderates the relationship between work alienation and emotional exhaustion. We conducted two time-lagged studies in China to test our research model. Studies 1 and 2 found that work alienation was positively related to knowledge hiding and that emotional exhaustion mediated this relationship. Study 2 revealed that job mobility attenuated the positive effect of work alienation on emotional exhaustion and the indirect effects of work alienation on evasive hiding, playing dumb, and rationalized hiding via emotional exhaustion. The present research sheds valuable light on the processes (how) and contingencies (when) whereby work alienation affects knowledge hiding for the first time, thus extending prior research and encouraging further explorations on the topic of work alienation and knowledge hiding.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2019.1579253;Emotional labor directed at leaders: the differential effects of surface and deep acting on LMX. We extend leader-member exchange (LMX) theory by examining subordinate emotional labor directed at leaders as a means of influencing LMX. Specifically, we propose that surface and deep acting have differential effects on supervisor support, which, in turn, influences subordinate perceptions of LMX. We develop a model in which supervisor support mediates the opposing indirect effects of surface and deep acting on LMX. We test this model with data collected in two waves from a sample of 590 employees and find empirical support for our hypotheses. Specifically, a series of hierarchical linear modeling analyses was conducted with Monte Carlo simulation. The test results showed that subordinate surface acting directed at supervisors has a detrimental indirect effect on subordinate perceptions of LMX, whereas deep acting directed at supervisors has the opposite (beneficial) effect. These findings indicate that subordinates can improve their relationships with their supervisors by engaging in deep acting;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1914129;Controlled by the algorithm, coached by the crowd - how HRM activities take shape on digital work platforms in the gig economy. An increasing number of workers turn to digital platforms - such as Fiverr, Freelancer, and Upwork - as an alternative to traditional work arrangements. Digital platforms govern how gig workers join, move through, and leave platforms - often with the help of self-learning algorithms. While digital platforms and algorithms take on HRM practices, we know little about how HRM activities unfold on digital work platforms in the gig economy. The study therefore aims to understand how HRM activities apply to and take shape on digital platforms by studying worker perceptions. We combine supervised text analysis with an in-depth qualitative content analysis, relying on 12'924 scraped comments from an online forum of workers on Upwork. We outline five conversations on HRM practices that pertain to access and mobility, training and development, scoring and feedback, appraisal and control and platform literacy and support. Based on these findings, we build five propositions about how digital work platforms employ HRM activities. Our paper contributes to recent work on HRM on digital platforms by (1) developing a new mixed-methods approach that illustrates how the content of HRM practices may differ from traditional organizations, (2) highlighting the changing role of actors in creating HRM practices by introducing the concept of 'crowd-created' HRM practices, and (3) conceptualizing how digital platforms employ a 'hybrid HRM approach'.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2018.1510847;Off-the-job embeddedness as a moderator of the relationship between work and life conflict and turnover intention. The impact of work and life conflict on employee performance and turnover is well-understood. In contrast, the role of off-the-job embeddedness - the attachment of an employee to his or her life outside of work - needs clarification in respect to its potential to buffer the negative effects of work and life conflict on employee turnover intention. Drawing on conservation of resources and job embeddedness theories, we argue that off-the-job embeddedness represents a collection of potential social support resources that can assist people in coping with the stressors resulting from work and life conflict. Based on a sample of 341 employees, this paper examines if off-the-job embeddedness moderates the relationship between work and life conflict and employee turnover intention. This study finds that off-the-job embeddedness weakened the impact of work and life conflict on turnover intention for more embedded employees. The implications of these findings are discussed for management practise and for the development of theory related to off-the-job embeddedness.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1875494;An inter-disciplinary review of the literature on mental illness disclosure in the workplace: implications for human resource management. The purpose of this review is to consolidate the stock of empirical research relating to the disclosure or concealment of mental illness in the workplace. We present a comprehensive framework for understanding the challenges that employees and job applicants face surrounding mental illness and identity management. This review aims to synthesize the findings of studies pertaining to the decision to disclose (or not) mental illnesses in the workplace and to channel the findings into a comprehensive model that can serve as a stepping-stone for future research in the field of human resource management (HRM). From the review, we found that organizational support, social support, and individual differences were key antecedents of the decision to disclose. Disclosure also affects outcomes such as access to accommodations and support programs, helping behaviors, psychological wellbeing, and employment success. Practically speaking, this research contributes to the development of a safe and diverse organizational climate in which all employees, regardless of mental illness, feel included in their work environment.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2389870;The new HCN-expatriate context: a multi-source, multi-method investigation of American HCN support for BRICS expatriates. With the increasing internationalization of emerging market multinational corporations (EMNCs) especially from the BRICS counties (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South-Africa), the interactions between expatriates from these countries and the 'new' host country nationals (i.e. the U.S. American HCNs) is becoming a common organizational phenomenon. To better understand these interactions, in this study, we used two unique sources of data to examine the impact of HCNs willingness to offer support to expatriates. In Study 1, we used scenario-based experimental design with 571 HCNs from the US and examined their willingness to offer support to expatriates from the BRICS countries. In Study 2, 499 expatriates from the BRICS countries working in the US shared their actual experience with HCNs. Results from the two studies confirmed that expatriate humility was strongly associated with HCNs' willingness to offer social-emotional and instrumental support to expatriates. More specifically, we found that perceived trustworthiness and values similarity acted as the mediating mechanisms. Type of job (financial industry versus educational sector) had no impact on HCNs willingness to offer support, while expatriate country of origin was likely to impact HCN support in the experiment but was shown to have no impact in the actual expatriate experience. We discuss theoretical and practical implications and suggest future research directions.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2382478;Institutional logics in play at work: how applying an institutional logics approach to employees' intentions to quit contextualizes HRM. Organizational and human resource management (HRM) scholars have shown an increasing interest in examining how macro-level institutions influence individuals' behaviour, frequently adopting an institutional logics perspective. This approach encourages a holistic perspective, highlighting the multiplicity of logics within organizations. However, HRM studies that adopt an institutional logics approach often focus on just two logics (profession and HRM), downplaying other logics that influence individuals, and not fully assessing how a HRM logic plays out in organizations. Based on 54 interviews with Pakistani banking employees, we find that their perceptions of HRM effectiveness only partially explain their turnover intentions. Several logics (HRM, traditional leadership, corporation, professional, family, and religious logics) and their associated values are in play at work, and help to explain how HRM influences employees' intentions to quit. Consequently, we contend that the HRM literature that applies an institutional logics approach downplays the multiplicity of institutional logics embedded within local contexts, and overlooks how various institutional logics and their constituent values shape individuals' behaviour. Thus, this article highlights the importance of contextualizing HRM policies, ways for HRM research to fully benefit from the institutional logics approach, and the role of values in shaping employees' responses to enacted HRM policies.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2359517;Relational gatekeeper behaviour of HR managers in the Middle East: the role of informal networks. Wasta, the informal network context omnipresent in the Middle East, is widespread in human resource management (HRM) practices. Yet, its influence on the behaviour of HR managers has not been explored. Utilizing relational gatekeeping theory and the informal network perspective in conjunction with in-depth expert interviews with HR managers, we seek to explore whether and how informal networks (wasta) influence and shape their role in an Arab Middle Eastern context. Our findings indicate that the level of wasta penetration in organizations is reliant on the relational gatekeeping behaviours of HR managers. Furthermore, we show how HR managers compensate for structural deficiencies by leveraging their wasta-derived power to amplify their voices. Nevertheless, the findings also emphasize the significance of power sharing in reducing the expansion of culturally derived power associated with wasta, thereby limiting power dynamics and authority to that derived from the formal organizational hierarchy. These insights advance knowledge on gatekeeping behaviour in the Arab Middle Eastern context and contribute new knowledge regarding the operational modes of informal networks within organizations. Our findings underscore the pivotal role that HR managers play in shaping the organizational culture. From a practical perspective, we offer actionable solutions, such as power sharing through committee work, to enhance the effectiveness of the HR function.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2267426;Athletic participation brings more job opportunities, true or false?. Fair recruitment matters, as it affects employees, managers and the organization. The phenomenon of athletic-participation-preference (APP) concerns both scholars and managers, affecting the policy and implementation of fair recruitment. Drawing on the stereotype theories, the current research clarifies the formation and implications of APP in recruitment, along with three unique findings. Firstly, the influence of athletic participation in recruitment is not universal, as recruiters may possess different views. Secondly, the influence of athletic participation in recruitment is not consistent. APP does not boost wage, and the APP is perceived differently between age groups. Finally, team-spirit and goal-orientation are not relevant to APP, as both values exist in both sport and non-sport fields. Research findings have implied that recruiting education and trainings, ethics workshops, and recruiting experiences are crucial to the fair recruitment, alleviating the impact of athletic-participation-preference in recruitment. Suggestions for future studies and fair recruiting practices are also discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2237867;Talent management in German multinational firms in China: the role of headquarters-subsidiary relations. Despite the bourgeoning interest in talent management (TM) in the last two decades, limited research has been carried out to understand the diffusion of TM strategies and practices from home-country headquarters to their subsidiaries in host countries. Furthermore, extant firm-level research on TM tends to neglect the role of the macro-level context, particularly in emerging economies where talent shortage is acute and their institutional distance is large, with headquarters in developed countries. This study fills these knowledge gaps by exploring the TM of German multinational corporations (MNCs) and their subsidiaries in China. Drawing on qualitative data collected from 42 semi-structured interviews with senior managers, human resource professionals, and operations managers from six German MNCs and their subsidiaries in China, the study uncovers headquarters-subsidiary relations. We identify a portfolio of what we refer to as 'institutional shapers' and develop a model for future research. This study contributes to extant knowledge by contextualizing multi-level TM shapers from an institutional-cultural perspective, supported by cross-country empirical data based on informant triangulation.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2225281;Integrating utility analysis and workforce strategy research: suggestions for future work. Firms ask their employees to perform a wide variety of tasks, often with daunting time constraints. Research on the firm-level impact of these behaviors - including work in utility analysis (UA) and star employees - has a long and fruitful history, rich with managerial implications. In this paper I comment on research by Joo et al. (2022), who advanced the literature on UA and star employees by highlighting the effects of variance in workforce performance on important firm-level outcomes among 824,924 employees, pooled across 206 samples. In my view this literature can be substantially enhanced by incorporating important moderating and mediating variables that have been identified in the HR strategy literature. In addition, this work can also be improved by developing a better understanding of the causal processes through which star employees' performance helps to execute strategy, and through the development of better workforce analytics. Advancing this line of research will likely require both qualitative and quantitative research as well as extensive case studies on the identification and implementation of effective workforce strategies.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2227920;Playful work design, engagement and performance: the moderating roles of boredom and conscientiousness. This study uses proactivity and play theories to investigate playful work design - the personal initiative to change the psychological experience of work by redesigning work activities to be more fun and/or more competitive. We postulate that playful work design is positively related to job performance through work engagement. In addition, we hypothesize that this indirect relationship is positively moderated by boredom and negatively moderated by conscientiousness. To test these hypotheses, we conducted a two-wave study among 370 Israeli employees (response = 84%), with one month in-between both measurement waves. Consistent with hypotheses, results of mediation analyses showed that playful work design in the form of designing competition (but not designing fun) was indirectly and positively related to both in-role and extra-role performance, through work engagement. As predicted, the indirect effects of designing fun (but not designing competition) on in-role and extra-role performance were strongest for individuals who reported high (vs. low) levels of boredom. In addition, the indirect relationships of designing competition (but not designing fun) with in-role and extra-role performance through work-engagement were stronger for individuals who reported lower (versus higher) levels of conscientiousness. We discuss how these findings contribute to the theory and practice of playful work design.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2138494;The dynamic capability view in exploring the relationship between high-performance work systems and innovation performance. In this study, we develop and test a framework that theorizes how high-performance work systems (HPWS)-a set of interrelated HR practices-build dynamic capabilities (i.e. learning, integration, and reconfiguration capabilities), which in turn lead to innovation performance. We also hypothesize that organizations with a stronger innovation culture, where employees share a common understanding of the value and importance of innovation, will be better able to convert capabilities into innovation performance. We test our hypotheses using time-lagged, multisource data from 173 companies in the Iranian pharmaceutical industry, a knowledge-intensive, high-velocity environment highly dependent on HRs to innovate. Our results show that the relationship between HPWS and innovation performance is mediated by dynamic capabilities (DCs). Further, alongside finding support for the moderating effect of innovation culture in the relationship between DCs and innovation performance, we find that innovation culture moderates the indirect effect of HPWS on innovation performance via DCs such that innovation culture strengthens the mediated relationship. The theoretical and practical implications of our findings are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2129418;The slippery slope effect of patient incivility: unleashing the roles of surface acting and receiving help in employees' unethical behavior and organizational citizenship behavior. Drawing from job demands- resources model (JD-R), we examine how patient incivility (PI) is linked with nurses' unethical behavior (UB) and patient-oriented organizational citizenship behavior (POCB) through surface acting. Further, we introduced receiving help from colleagues as a boundary condition in the surface acting-unethical behavior and surface acting-POCB relationships. Two- wave multi source data gathered from 339 nurses and their colleagues working in various private hospitals of Lahore, Pakistan. We found support for the two contrasting hypotheses that patient incivility (PI) is positively associated with nurses' unethical behavior (UB) and negatively associated with patient-oriented organizational citizenship behavior (POCB) with the mediating role of surface acting. Receiving help from colleagues moderates surface acting-unethical behavior relationship such that it mitigates the negative effects of surface acting on unethical behavior whereas no moderation was found for surface acting-POCB relationship.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2054286;Fake it or make it to stay? A case of Pakistani frontline emergency rescue workers. Drawing from the job demands-resources (JD-R) model and job characteristics model (JCM), this study examined the relationship between emergency rescue workers' surface acting and turnover intentions through emotional exhaustion. We hypothesized that task significance is a pertinent boundary condition that attenuates the surface acting-emotional exhaustion relationship. We also introduced job control as another boundary condition in the emotional exhaustion-turnover intentions relationship. Three-wave data gathered from 256 emergency rescue workers revealed that participants' surface acting increased their emotional exhaustion which triggered their intention to quit. Task significance was found to moderate the surface acting-emotional exhaustion relationship, such that the interaction effect at medium and high levels drastically reduces the exhaustion level of emergency workers. Individuals with high job control show high turnover intentions in the case of those with medium and high emotional exhaustion. These findings have significant implications for human resource management research and practice, especially around job design for those emergency rescue workers likely serving as emotional laborers.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2032265;Talent management and performance in the public sector: the role of organisational and line managerial support for development. While research shows that talent management (TM) practices are linked to individual and organisational outcomes, little is known about the mechanisms through which these processes unfold, especially in the public sector of emerging market economies. This exploratory study investigates TM in the public sector context of Bahrain addressing an important research gap. Drawing on Organisational Support Theory (OST) and strategic human resource management (SHRM) literature, we test the role of line managerial support for development (LMSD) and organisational support for development (OSD) as mechanisms through which TM practices influence individual talent performance. Results from a survey based on a talent pool of a Bahraini governmental administrative institution show that LMSD fully mediates the relationship between TM practices and each of the individual talent performance indicators, apart from task performance. We also find that the indirect relationship between TM and individual talent performance was significant at low levels of OSD. The study contributes to unlocking the TM black box in the public sector of developing countries by highlighting the key role of line managers in the implementation of TM practices revealing a substitution effect between LMSD and OSD, as interchangeable sources of developmental support that can enhance talent performance in this context.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.2013923;Impact of women and ethics committees on firms' value and financial performance. The literature on the impact of gender diversity on firms' value and performance is mixed. To shed light on these mixed results, we consider that other mechanisms in place, such as committees, could help gender diversity prosper. We investigate the joint effects of whether women acting on the corporate board or as executive officers, and the presence of an ethics and compliance committee (ECC), impact on firms' value and financial performance. Our identification strategy covers three different methods (i) system GMM, (ii) generalized structural equation model approach, and (iii) propensity score matching approach. The results show that firms' value and performance increase when a woman is in the corporate board or as an executive officer, and the firm has an ECC. Unlike previous literature, we show that ECCs, further than just a monitoring mechanism, support minority groups (women), and this has second-order effects on firms' value and performance. Besides, we provide evidence for practitioners to foster the increase of quotas for women in top executive roles and consider fostering the creation of ECCs.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1986563;How can CEOs influence HRM implementation? Unfolding top management's role in HRM. This paper investigates how CEOs can influence the implementation of HRM policies in their organizations. It does so by comparing the HRM implementation roles of the same CEO in two different companies as well as those of different CEOs in the same firm. Based on the findings, the study inductively develops a model that describes different types of CEO direct and indirect influence, unfolding the generic label of CEO 'support' into a wide catalogue of actions, and identifying further behaviours other than support. The results also challenge some established ideas, such as the view of CEOs' HRM role solely as strategic decision makers, or that CEO influence necessarily involves overt action. Finally, our findings open several avenues for future research on a relevant and, so far, underdeveloped topic.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1964093;Voice in non-traditional employment relationships: a review and future research directions. Research on employee voice has been widely documented for workers in traditional employment relationships (TERs) and has offered a broad understanding of how they express their ideas and complaints at work. However, an under-explored area concerns how workers express voice in non-traditional employment relationships (NTERs) characterised by flexibility, temporality, instability, and insecurity. Studying voice in NTERs is of high importance due to its increased potential proliferation and associated precariousness. In this paper, we expand the knowledge frontiers in the voice literature by conducting an integrative review of empirical studies that explore voice among workers in NTERs. We identify the forms of voice available to non-traditional workers, the issues they are interested in voicing, how effective their voice is in influencing management decisions, determinants, and outcomes of their voice. Future research agenda offered concerning how the neglected area of voice among non-traditional workers can be addressed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1961161;A moderated mediation study of high performance work systems and insomnia on New Zealand employees: job burnout mediating and work-life balance moderating. We explore the wellbeing of employees (via insomnia and job burnout) due to the importance of a healthy workforce. High Performance Work Systems (HPWS) have been argued as playing a central role, and the present study explores a path model whereby HPWS influences job burnout (emotional exhaustion, cynicism) and then insomnia. Further, work-life balance (WLB) is included as a theoretically derived moderator which might attenuate relationships. These relationships are tested using a sample of 306 employees with time-lagged data, using moderated mediation analysis. The findings show that HPWS is significantly related to all constructs, and while burnout mediates HPWS effects, there remain significant indirect effects. Further, WLB predicts all wellbeing outcomes and interacts with HPWS towards cynicism, and then acts as a boundary condition on the moderated mediation model. Ultimately, we find the indirect effect of HPWS on insomnia (through cynicism) becomes weaker as employee WLB gets stronger. The findings suggest that managing employee wellbeing is a complex process working through various factors, although HPWS appear to play a key role with WLB. The implications for HR are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1948889;Heeding the call from the promised land: identity work of self-initiated expatriates before leaving home. Despite growing interest in self-initiated expatriates (SIEs), we know little about how SIEs develop the aspiration to leave both home employers and home countries behind. Based on rich empirical data from Western European SIEs, who migrated to North America, we explored key dynamics of identity work leading up to their decision to expatriate. We found that an SIE's self-concept as a talented professional is initially negatively impacted by interactions with their home employers. However, through elevating conversations with 'trusted outsiders', SIEs engage in re-crafting a more positive sense of self. SIEs associate the trusted outsiders' foreign professional background with idealized future work environments, the 'promised land', in which they see their elevated selves fulfilled. Our findings have important implications for research on drivers of self-initiated expatriation, voluntary turnover and talent management.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1925324;Executive pay dispersion: Reconciling the differing effects of pay inequality and pay inequity on firm performance. Debate persists regarding the effects of executive pay dispersion on firm performance given that conflicting findings have plagued the literature. We aim to reconcile previous inconsistencies by taking a more nuanced approach and exploring the effects of explained and unexplained executive pay dispersion on the firm's short- and long-term performance. Using a longitudinal sample of public firms over a 12-year period, we find that unexplained pay dispersion among executives-indicating pay inequity-negatively affects short-term firm performance while explained pay dispersion-indicating pay inequality-positively affects long-term firm performance. The findings help resolve prior inconsistencies associated with understanding the relationship between executive pay dispersion and firm performance. Accordingly, we advance research by demonstrating the importance of measuring pay dispersion types and accounting for the temporal nature of firm performance.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This study advances a differentiated understanding of job ad pre-hire effectiveness. It analyzes the utility values for varying levels of job ad attributes through a hierarchical Bayesian approach to conjoint analysis. This method allows not only to measure the relative importance of different attributes on the individual level but also to explore heterogeneity in evaluations influenced by educational level, international career orientation and time to graduation. The main results from the experiment show that for both undergraduate and graduate business students, salary and opportunity for advancement by far outweigh employer familiarity and the description of job-related tasks. The study contributes to the recruitment literature by assessing to what extent these four core attributes of a job ad drive job pursuit intentions. It also discusses the implications of attribute trade-offs for employer branding activities.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2018.1499669;Signals of support: flexible work for mutual gain. Even where organizational policy provides for flexible work arrangements (FWAs), uptake of FWAs depends on employee perceptions of supervisor and organizational support for flexible work. Supervisor support has previously been identified as having significant influence on employee uptake of FWAs as supervisors can encourage or discourage FWA use. Supervisors work within an organizational context, so understanding how that organizational context shapes supervisor support is critical to improving FWA implementation. Incorporating both signaling theory and HR process theory, this case study of an Australian insurance organization examines the signals of support for FWAs that exist within an organization, and the influence of these signals, both explicit and implicit, on supervisor implementation of FWAs. The findings demonstrate how organizational statements, infrastructure investment, senior manager behavior, and organizational discourse shape supervisor support for FWAs. Theoretically, the study demonstrates that signals are an important feature of a strong HR system and can lead to a discourse of mutual gains which ultimately limits the use of particular FWAs, despite policy ostensibly supporting them. More broadly, the study contributes to a deeper understanding of how the implementation of HR policy can differ from HR policy intent.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The study investigates to what extent empowering HRM practices (i.e., workplace flexibility, professional autonomy, and access to knowledge via ICT) and empowering leadership have the potential to motivate employees in displaying workplace proactivity in NWW contexts. The study builds on the empowerment theory to gain a better understanding of how employees are able to make choices in order to achieve the goals set in their work and how leadership can support this. A field study was conducted in four subsidiaries of a large Dutch bank active in the financial sector. In line with expectations, positive relationships were found between professional autonomy, access to knowledge via ICT and empowering leadership, on the one hand, and psychological empowerment, on the other. Also, in line with expectations, a positive relationship was found between psychological empowerment and workplace proactivity. Moreover, as hypothesized, psychological empowerment partly mediated the relationship between the HRM practices and empowering leadership and workplace proactivity. However, autonomy had a direct, negative effect on workplace proactivity. Also workplace flexibility was neither directly nor indirectly associated with workplace proactivity. Finally, HRM and leadership can be viewed as complementary as they combine different perspectives for employees in order to display proactive workplace behaviour. In conclusion, the empowerment process approach helped to disentangle the motivating elements that foster workplace proactivity in modern workplaces.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Expatriation significantly influences the career paths of individuals after their international work experience. This study draws on person-environment fit and career construction theories to examine the role of job fit, career adaptability, and expatriate type in shaping both objective and subjective career success. Our 2020 sample comprised 191 expatriates who had worked abroad four to five years prior. This group included both self-initiated and assigned expatriates, as well as repatriates and re-expatriates, providing a broader scope than is typical in expatriation studies. The research reveals that job fit, career adaptability, and expatriate type substantially affect career outcomes. It also identifies that the type of expatriate moderates the relationship between career adaptability and objective career success. Our work extends the applicability of person-environment fit theory and career construction theory within the complex landscape of expatriate careers. The investigation not only deepens our understanding of the factors driving career success post-expatriation but also provides valuable insights to aid the effective management of international careers.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2024.2342297;Filling talent shortages with foreign students? Understanding foreign exchange students' willingness to work for host-country organizations. Foreign exchange students can serve as a valuable talent pool for host-country organizations. This study draws on the ability-motivation-opportunity framework and the intergroup contact theory to examine how foreign exchange students' motivation to study abroad, host-country language ability, and direct and indirect contact opportunities with host-country nationals are related to their willingness to work for host-country organizations. Data were collected from a multi-wave survey of 167 foreign exchange students in Germany. Providing support for our hypotheses, the results suggest that foreign exchange students' motivation to study abroad was positively related to direct contact opportunities (e.g. interacting with locals). Further, exchange students' host-country language ability was positively related to indirect contact opportunities (e.g. visiting cultural sights), which in turn was positively related to their willingness to work for host-country organizations. Opportunities for direct interpersonal contact were not significantly related to willingness to work for host-country organizations. The results also show two-way and three-way interactions among host-country ability, motivation to study abroad, and indirect contact opportunities in predicting exchange students' willingness to work for host-country organizations. Implications for theory, management practice, and policymaking are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2023.2211711;Crafting for oneself while considering others: how the relational design of work shapes job crafting. Job crafting is a concept of increasing interest to human resource management (HRM), as it involves employees re-designing their jobs to maintain and increase their person-job fit. Job crafting is seen as an individual's self-focused approach to his/her work, and the way other people influence and are influenced by these behaviors is understudied. We built on the relational work design theory and used focus group interviews of 44 employees and thematic analysis method to explore how job crafting is shaped by interactions with others at work. Our results show that relational work characteristics, namely contact with other people and impact on other people, shape the way jobs are crafted. Further, we find that jobs are crafted by mobilizing the relational work design and adapting to it. Based on these findings, we present a typology of four general job crafting strategies. We advance theory on how individuals craft their jobs to consider not just themselves but also others. This study has implications for job crafting theory and HRM by highlighting how the relational properties of work shape the way employees craft their jobs.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Solo-living employees are a growing segment of the workforce, yet their work-life experiences are under-researched. Taking a biographical narrative approach, we interviewed 35 solo-livers from different countries to explore their transition to homeworking during the Covid-19 lockdowns. Drawing upon the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model and key concepts from the work-life interface literature, we explored both lost/reduced and new/increased job and personal demands and resources at this time. We found that the transition to homeworking during lockdown created several challenges for solo-living staff, often exacerbated by changes to the demands and resources of others - namely those with childcare responsibilities. We argue that 'sense of entitlement to support for work-life balance' is an important personal resource, which impacts the work-life interface, and which solo-living staff often lack. Our findings offer solo-friendly recommendations for organisational practice.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The value of graduate development programmes (GDPs) from a talent management (TM) perspective is unknown. The contemporary TM literature focuses primarily on talent programmes for existing employees whereas less attention has been placed on externally recruited talent pools, in particular graduates. Attracting graduate talent is a priority for many organisations, as evidenced by the amount of investment contributed to this activity, but research on the employer's intended outcomes and expectations of participants in GDPs seems to lack coherence. To bridge this gap, this paper aims to develop a conceptual model to explicate the nature and process of GDP, using TM and the wider career literature. The model helps in our understanding of what contextual factors are important and how these factors influence policy and practice to GDPs. We also explore the value of GDPs based on the psychological contract perspective in a contemporary career system. To achieve these aims, the paper investigates how the design and agenda of GDPs may be reframed by analysing several literatures including talent pool segmentation, identity, psychological contract theory and career management. We also expand the existing TM literature by exploring the factors that directly impact the outcomes of GDPs and set future research agenda.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2022.2113820;The pragmatic side of workplace heroics: a -self-interest perspective on responding to mistreatment in work teams. Research on third-party reactions to workplace mistreatment has often focused on a moral perspective, but has devoted limited attention to the role of self-interest. Drawing from a self-interest perspective, we develop a conceptual model that examines how self-interest influences third-party responses to mistreatment within work teams. Several important relational (justice reputation, social status, relationship with the target, power) and situational (number of observers, mistreatment intensity) factors are posited to influence third-party perceptions of team members' expectations for their intervention, and perceptions of the expected salience of their response to their team members. These perceived expectations for intervention are theorized to positively influence the expected salience of their response, which is strengthened under conditions of ethical leadership, ethical climate, and ethical HRM practices. In turn, third parties use a cost-benefit analysis to decide how to respond in a manner that serves their interests, which is moderated by several key factors (probability that intervention alleviates the mistreatment, perceived risk of intervention, third-party vulnerability). We advance a novel process-based conceptual model that provides an alternative lens as to why third parties may intervene during mistreatment within work teams.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper examines how agency and structure interact to influence the changing nature of careers in the French Humanitarian Sector - a sector that is undergoing a significant shift towards increased professionalization. Drawing on Giddens structuration theory, the study uses the concept of career script as a dynamic framework to understand both career stability and change. Data was collected at both an individual and organizational level to identify three careers scripts in operation in the field and examine the ways in which they evolve over time. The paper provides an analysis of the power relations involved in the development of career scripts and the professionalization of the humanitarian sector, suggesting a potentially greater role for agency than is typically acknowledged. Finally the paper concludes with a consideration of the wider implications for the study of career change in the future.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2018.1522656;The moderating role of HR practices on the career adaptability-job crafting relationship: a study among employee-manager dyads. This study aims to investigate whether career adaptability could enhance an employee's work engagement through job crafting behaviors and to address the role of HR practices in this relationship. Based on career construction theory, we first examine whether career adaptability, as a self-regulatory competency may trigger enhanced job crafting behaviors, which in turn increase employee's work engagement. Second, we propose a moderation model in which different implemented high-performance work practices (HPWPs) moderate the relationship between career adaptability and job crafting. The results show that job crafting mediated the positive relationship between career adaptability and work engagement. The results support the hypothesized moderation only for opportunity-enhancing HPWPs. The relationship between career adaptability and job crafting is positive and significant for medium and high opportunity-enhancing HPWPs, but not for low levels of this HPWPs domain. The results imply that through the implementation of opportunity-enhancing HPWPs organizations can create a room for employees to express their adaptability at work through crafting their jobs, which in turn relates to work engagement.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2021.1897643;Humanoid robot adoption and labour productivity: a perspective on ambidextrous product innovation routines. The increasing presence of humanoid robot adoption has generated a change in explorative and exploitative routines. If the explorative routines provoke creativity and critical thinking which are delivered by humans, exploitative routines induce repetitive actions and mimic activities which are executed by humanoids. This has raised the need for a better balance between both routines involving an ambidextrous dynamic process. Here, product innovations play a relevant role in enhancing such balance and labour productivity. If, from the conceptual standpoint, this phenomenon has already been explored, there is still the need to empirically analyse it. We thus offer a meso-analysis of twenty-four countries located in Europe through the lens of the Service Robot Deployment (SRD) Model and the conceptual lens of organizational ambidexterity. By a regression methodology, the results show that humanoid robot adoption is still not affecting labour productivity which, by contrast, is positively and significantly connected with both radically new and marginally modified/unchanged production of innovative routines. Our original contribution, which falls in the field of Human Resources Management and Artificial Intelligence, is that humanoids are not directly impacting labour productivity but indirectly through the generation of both new and marginally modified (or unchanged) routines. This situation persuades senior leaders to achieve a balance between exploitative and explorative product innovation routines.

Employing longitudinal data, we examine how income mediates, and sexual identity moderates, the gender-job satisfaction relationship using the theoretical lens of human capital theory.

This article explores how employees with mental illness perceive HRM and its impact, drawing on consumer-centred perspectives. Using the case of consumer-workers employed for their lived experience of mental illness in mental health care services, we investigate the degree to which they feel included or marginalised by HR systems, processes and practices. Through a mixed method study designed along co-production principles, we found consumer-workers faced different but interrelated problems stemming from their status: a general lack of understanding of the role and its purpose;art; secondly, we illustrate why HR scholars need to engage with varied paradigms of knowledge about mental illness beyond the dominant medical/psychiatric one;" and thirdly, we demonstrate a methodology that not only explores employee perspectives, but includes employees in the research design and process."",art";;;;;;;;;;;;;

Using an international sample of 2,200 firms during 2000-2016, we show that analyst accuracy decreases significantly when intangible intensity grows. In exploring the determinants of this effect, we distinguish between firm risk and the risk associated with intangibles. Our results reveal the role of financial reporting quality, ownership structure, and institutional quality in moderating the relationship between intangible intensity and analyst accuracy. Analyst forecast accuracy acts as a channel through which the higher levels of information asymmetry associated with intangible intensity affect the cost of equity. Our results are robust to different intangible intensity measures;art;" and financial crisis periods.

This article contributes to the literature by indicating how certain monetary policies impact the compensation incentives of US managers to adopt riskier business policies. Specifically, based on the agency problems between shareholders and managers and between shareholders and creditors, a research framework is developed to identify the influence of low interest rates on managers' risk-taking incentives proxied by the sensitivity of executive compensation to stock return volatility (Vega). We examine 1,293 firms in the United States between 2000 and 2016, and the results indicate that low interest rates increase the managers' short-term risk-taking incentives and that those incentives contribute to the risk effectively taken by the firm. Our results are robust to the use of alternative monetary proxies and to the presence of passive versus active institutional shareholders. JEL CLASSIFICATION E41;art; M12;" M52"",art";;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1177/2340944420916307;Is the formalization of NPD collaboration productive or counterproductive? Contingent effects of trust between partners. New product development (NPD) collaborations with external partners involve high coordination costs and run substantial risks. Formalization seems to be an effective mechanism to mitigate said costs and risks, although the issue of whether formalization actually proves productive or counterproductive remains an open question. This study empirically analyses the direct impact of formalization and the interaction effect between formalization and trust between partners in order to gauge their influence on NPD collaboration performance. Findings indicate that formalization directly boosts the quality and novelty of the new product developed in collaboration, but that it does not affect adherence to schedule. In addition, trust reinforces the productive effect of formalization on new product quality and novelty, and makes the impact of formalization on adherence to schedule positive. However, without trust, we find a null impact of formalization on new product quality and a counterproductive impact on adherence to schedule. These results suggest that formalization and trust may complement each other, reinforcing each other's positive effect on new product quality and novelty and presenting a positive synergistic effect, while helping to overcome the counterproductive effect of formalization on adherence to schedule.JEL CLASSIFICATION: O32;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1177/2340944420924402;How much control do firms exercise over their resources when entering emerging markets? The influence of institutional voids on entry mode degree of control. The international management literature has presented inconclusive results about the effect of institutional voids in a host country on entrant firms' resource commitment. With the lens of institutional theory and transaction cost theory, this article examines how institutional voids in an emerging market influence a firm's decision to move resources in that market. Resource commitment in an emerging market is examined in terms of the degree of control of the entry strategy employed. The theory presented argues that as institutional voids in a firm's host country escalate, the firm sets out different priority actions to mitigate behavioral and environmental uncertainties in the host country, that in turn affect the degree of control of its entry modes. By relying on a sample of 90 Italian firms operating in China between 2001 and 2010, the results support the hypothesis that the institutional voids-entry mode degree of control relationship displays an inverted U-shape.

The analysis of ambidexterity at the individual level may help to open the black box of organizational ambidexterity and to address the microfoundations of the exploration/exploitation dilemma in order to know how it can be achieved. The purpose of this article is to examine the main characteristics, antecedents, and consequences of individual ambidexterity, highlighting several key theoretical and methodological issues. Through a systematic literature review, we synthesize and integrate knowledge about individual ambidexterity, identifying opportunities and challenges for future research. We propose a multilevel framework that includes antecedents, consequences, and contingent effects of individual ambidexterity and their relationships. This multilevel framework may help to overcome the micro-macro divide in the management field. We also provide a synthesis of future research proposals. JEL CLASSIFICATION: M10;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1177/23409444221138582;Turnover intentions and safety compliance in the military: A psychological contract perspective. NATO members have been coping with low motivation and morale. Such environments typically have high turnover intentions and neglect behavior. However, safety behavior is paramount for military organizations and neglect behavior can have serious consequences. Social exchanges are often cited as the main reason for these phenomena. We therefore examine turnover intentions and safety compliance behavior of 1,593 airmen from a European NATO Air Force by focusing on different psychological contract (PC) dimensions. We use polynomial regression and response surface analysis. Results show that higher levels of PC fulfillment are related to lower levels of turnover intentions and higher levels of safety compliance behavior. Furthermore, perceptions of PC overfulfillment are negatively associated with turnover intentions, whereas safety compliance is unaffected by positive (overfulfillment) and negative (underfulfillment) PC discrepancies along all PC dimensions. We discuss implications for the PC literature, make suggestions for future research, and provide practical implications.

We also aim to test whether these effects were conditioned by the global financial crisis of 2008. Using a sample of 15,356 firms from 29 countries (2001-2017), we found that in normal times or in countries not very severely affected by the financial crisis, trade credit receivables increase during monetary restrictions. Moreover, this increase is less pronounced as creditor protection strengthens. In countries strongly affected by the financial crisis, however, trade credit receivables do not react or even decrease after monetary expansions, regardless of the degree of creditor protection. Furthermore, the results of trade credit payables and net trade credit are not conclusive.JEL CLASSIFICATION: E52;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This research focuses on the role of gender and physical attractiveness in judging severity of unethical workplace behavior. Scenarios with possible ethical dilemmas (commonly referred to as gray areas of behavior) were displayed to 4,483 subjects. Our findings show that gray area behavior was evaluated as more ethical if performed by male employees compared with women. We also found that attractiveness moderated the connection between gender and tolerance toward unethical work behavior. People judge more severely the same unethical action by plain-looking employees rather than attractive-looking employees, in accordance with the attractiveness-leniency effect-but only for women perpetrators. The physical attributes of men were not found to be relevant.

10.1177/2340944420933629;The effectiveness of R&D subsidies in fostering firm innovation: The role of knowledge-sourcing activities. This article presents a novel conceptual framework that uses the notion of knowledge sourcing to explain how firms realize benefits from R&D subsidies in terms of innovations. The study considers two dimensions of the firm's knowledge sourcing: its R&D effort and level of openness to technology markets. This article proposes that the policy-induced effects of R&D subsidies on the knowledge-sourcing process increase firms' innovation outcomes, thus making this policy intervention effective in promoting innovation. By using panel data from Spanish manufacturing firms, this article presents evidence consistent with the hypothesis that by changing the knowledge sourcing of firms, National R&D subsidy programs in Spain also favor more firm innovation, measured by patent applications and new product launches. It is also documented that the granting of R&D subsidies does not affect firm innovation directly but rather through inducing changes in the firm's R&D effort and openness to technology markets.

10.1177/23409444211002521;High-performance work practices, socioemotional wealth preservation, and family firm labor productivity*. Despite growing research on the effect of high-performance work practices (HPWPs) on family firm performance, the implications of socioemotional wealth (SEW) preservation remain ambiguous. This stems from SEW preservation being used primarily as an explanatory construct and assessed indirectly rather than directly in empirical studies. To address this research gap, we draw upon organizational control and signaling theories to determine the true interaction between HPWPs and SEW preservation for labor productivity. Specifically, competing hypotheses are presented to determine if this interaction supports complementarity or substitutability. Using a sample of 124 Spanish family firms and a direct measurement of SEW preservation, our results provide support for substitutability, suggesting that family firms can realize higher labor productivity when HPWPs are fully implemented and commitment to SEW preservation is low, and vice versa. These findings have important implications for family firms, given HPWPs' inverse relationship with SEW preservation regarding labor productivity.JEL CLASSIFICATIONJ24, L20, L21, L26, M12_M12, M54_M54, O15;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Despite existing evidence indicating that organizational learning positively influences dynamic capabilities, the complex and dynamic interplay of leadership in this process still remains incomplete. Organizational learning models note that leadership is embedded in the development of dynamic capabilities, and this research empirically investigates the interplay of organizational learning (exploitative and exploratory learning) and strategic leadership (transformational and transactional leadership) in developing dynamic capabilities (sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring). A survey questionnaire on a sample of 106 firms is carried out, and results of hierarchical linear regressions indeed reveal that organizational learning shows a direct or indirect influence on dynamic capabilities through transactional or transformational leadership, depending on the type of department. This study is an innovative attempt to distinguish different antecedents for each type of dynamic capability on the basis of the type of learning and strategic leadership involved.

10.1177/23409444211009528;Talent management challenges during COVID-19 and beyond: Performance management to the rescue. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant talent management challenges including (a) hiring freezes and layoffs;art; and (d) increased employee stress and burnout. Also, COVID-19 has made it evident that many organizations do not implement state-of-the-science performance management systems and, instead, have just performance appraisal systems that typically involve a once-a-year evaluation and review, little effort to provide feedback and coaching on an ongoing basis, little alignment between employee performance and the organization's strategic goals, a focus on past performance only, and ownership by the human resources function instead of those rating and being rated. Thus, the lack of value contributed by the usual performance evaluation and review process is the reason why so many organizations are postponing or even completely discontinuing performance evaluations. We argue that when implemented using evidence-based recommendations, performance management (rather than appraisal) serves important administrative, strategic and communication, developmental, organizational maintenance, and documentation purposes and therefore can be particularly useful in addressing contemporary talent management challenges. We offer five recommendations on how to adapt and improve performance management that will help organizations navigate crises like COVID-19 and, just as importantly, allow them to thrive after the crisis is over: (1) measure results in addition to behaviors, (2) measure adaptive performance, (3) conduct stay interviews to retain top performers, (4) implement a multisource performance management system, and (5) collect and use performance promoter scores.JEL CLASSIFICATION: J5 Labor-Management Relations, Trade Unions, and Collective Bargaining; M1 Business Administration;" M5 Personnel Economics"",art";;;;;;;;;;;;

The results identified the following key quality determinants: functional aspects of durability and safety, and hedonic aspects of enjoyment, awareness, novelty, and image. The result implies that most s-commerce service firms fail to efficiently convert the enhancement of safety, awareness, and novelty into consumer satisfaction.

Using agency theory and stakeholder theory, and a database of 5,603 firm-year observations from European companies in the period 2012-2021, we find that CSR aligns the interests of senior executives with the company's green innovation goals through green compensation contracts. We also explore the indirect effect in this relationship and reveal that the implementation of green practices mediates the impact of CSR contracting on green innovation performance. These findings indicate that CSR contracting as an effective governance mechanism could be strengthened by green practices, such as reducing resource use, water efficiency, energy reuse, emission reduction and pollution prevention. This study offers valuable insights for senior executives and policymakers who wish to manage CSR initiatives and green practices to improve their green innovation performance.JEL CLASSIFICATION: Q56 M12;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Our analysis of the location decisions of 295 luxury beach hotels in Spain between 1960 and 2015 reveals two main findings. First, we confirm the positive relationship between the existence of demand-related urbanization services around natural resources and the attractiveness of agglomerations to new entrants. Second, we find that an agglomeration's attractiveness negatively affects the density of firms in the agglomeration if that attractiveness hinders firms' access to the same natural resources. Our results contribute to the strategy literature on agglomerations and provide a better understanding of how the tourism industry can work toward achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs).

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) seek to achieve economic, social, and environmental progress globally. However, trade-offs among these three pillars might occur, particularly in the context of cities. We argue that these trade-offs exist because the traditional factors of production for economic welfare are not always relevant to the other dimensions of city sustainability. Consequently, additional factors are needed to facilitate the progress of the 2030 agenda. We make a case for smart governance, a factor that we associate with the quality of governance. We explore these ideas by examining the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of 128 cities worldwide. Our results indicate that the traditional factors of production (labor, land, and capital) are positively associated with the economic dimension but weakly associated with the social and environmental dimensions. However, smart governance is positively associated with the various dimensions of urban sustainability. JEL CLASSIFICATION: Q01;art; Q56; O18;" Z13"",art";;;;;;;;;;;;

Based on the optimal board independence theory, we analyze how Spanish listed firms determine the presence of genuine and gray independent directors. We classify independents as gray whenever they do not satisfy formal independence requirements. Given the findings in previous literature, this type of gray independent does not promote poor corporate governance practices. Our results suggest that the presence of gray and genuine independent directors is related to the optimal board independence determinants as if both provided real board independence. Results are not affected by the number and the type of unsatisfied independence criteria, nor by the firm's achievement of regulators' recommended level of board independence. Therefore, we conclude that firms pay little attention to formal independence requirements to reach their optimal board structure. JEL CLASSIFICATION: G30;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this study, we investigate the response intentions of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) during the recent economic crisis initiated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We draw on the cognitive appraisal theory and investigate how an SME's level of proactivity triggers top managers' emotional reactions, which in the end shapes an SME's response strategies (investment vs divestment). To test our assumptions, we use survey data from 155 top managers of Croatian SMEs operating in business-to-business industries. We find that an SME's proactivity positively (negatively) influences the emergence of positive (negative) emotions. Also, we find that top managers charged with positive (negative) emotions are more prone to engage in investment (divestment) as a response to economic crisis. Furthermore, through the broaden-and-build perspective we reveal the mediating effect of emotions on the relationship between proactivity and response intentions as well as the mediating effect of performance expectations on the link between emotions and response intentions.JEL CLASSIFICATION M10;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We find robust evidence that co-option mitigates both real activities and accrual-based earnings management. Our findings support the view that higher co-option reduces managerial short-termism because it enhances managers' job security as co-opted directors are known to be less likely to remove managers from office. Our results are robust to different measures of both co-option and earnings management, and they continue to hold after accounting for endogeneity and selection concerns. Finally, we provide additional evidence showing that a higher degree of co-option lowers the likelihood of the chief executive officer (CEO) being forcefully removed from the office for managing earnings in the previous year.JEL CLASSIFICATION G30;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Drawing on agency theory, we propose that corporate governance mechanisms play a significant role in determining the value of firms' dynamic capabilities. In particular, we develop theoretical propositions about the differential effect of two corporate governance mechanisms-board monitoring and managerial incentives-on the value of dynamic capabilities in the form of complex codified routines, on one hand, and simple rules, on the other hand, at different levels of environmental dynamism.

However, all the accounting-based measures, especially Altman's Z-score, come closest to the market-based measures when used to assess the credit risk of family firms. The two types of measures also coincide more closely in their default risk orderings of family than of non-family firms. Useful practical implications can be drawn from these findings, which show that accounting-based measures can be used reliably in the absence of market data for family firms with similar characteristics to those in our sample.

Therefore, this study aims at examining whether firms around the world facing positive and negative performance feedback undertake different search behaviors. Furthermore, we test whether firm's corporate governance mechanisms strengthen such search behaviors.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates the limits of this stance, as its influence on business has been both enormous and palpable. For the most part, the effects of the pandemic are no doubt negative. Business research-and presumably business practice-typically address such influence in terms of failure, resilience, and crisis management among existing businesses. Contrasting this prevalent discourse, we focus instead on positive influence of the pandemic for some emerging and new ventures. We analyze the many possible positive effects on entrepreneurship practice and highlight also positive effects on entrepreneurship research. We illustrate both positives by applying the External Enabler framework.JEL CLASSIFICATION: L26, M13, O3, R11;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This study offers insight into the role of board politicization on the Spanish cajas' performance from a dual perspective. First, we analyze the effect of a new kind of political directors who occupy board seats as representatives of stakeholders outside the public administrations while maintaining a political affiliation. We call these hidden political directors as politicians in disguise. Second, we analyze how political interests can prevent directors with financial expertise from applying their knowledge to improve cajas' performance. Using a sample of hand-collected data from 45 Spanish cajas, we find that politicians in disguise destroy value in the caja and that politically motivated financial experts on the board do not benefit cajas' performance.JEL CLASSIFICATION: G34, G21, G28;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1177/2340944421994117;Successful turnarounds in bankrupt firms? Assessing retrenchment in the most severe form of crisis. During economic downturns, firms file for bankruptcy in an effort to attempt a turnaround. The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of retrenchment strategies in the context of bankruptcy, as the most severe form of crisis. We conducted a longitudinal analysis of a sample of 868 bankrupt Spanish firms during the period 2004-2017. The empirical results show that stakeholder support and deep cost retrenchment increase the likelihood of survival and performance recovery, while aggressive layoffs are detrimental for turning bankrupt firms around. Surprisingly, intense asset retrenchment had no significant effects on firm survival and also pushed performance downward. The findings suggest that retrenchment should not be regarded as a general remedy for firms suffering the most severe of crisis. Bankrupt firms should focus on restoring stakeholder relationships and reducing superfluous expenses, while making employees redundant or selling assets should be evaluated carefully when attempting a turnaround.JEL CLASSIFICATION M10;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1177/23409444231184483;Braking before the curve and accelerating inside? Exploration, countercyclical behavior, and SMEs' resilience during economic downturns. Some studies have provided empirical evidence that firms' high growth rates just before economic crises are negatively associated with resilience. Other authors have observed that firms that grow fast in the early phases of an external crisis are generally more resilient. This countercyclical behavior is less common in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and literature has not delved into the underlying factors that facilitate SMEs' countercyclical strategies. Firm exploration is defined as a firm's willingness to experiment, take risks, be flexible, and accept variation. Our thesis is that exploration acts as a countercyclical factor by slowing down a firm's growth before the external shock takes effect, favoring growth during the crisis, and providing better resilience outcomes. We find support for our hypotheses from a sample of 2,081 manufacturing medium-sized enterprises. Jel Classification: M10 GENERAL;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1177/23409444221110588;The reaction to CSR controversies by institutional investors. Despite the importance of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) firm controversies, little is known about their effect on institutional investors. We study the most important institutional investors worldwide: pension funds and mutual funds. The separation between fund management and ownership raises the need to examine how fund managers and fund participants react to investee-firms' CSR controversies. Considering the conventional/Socially Responsible Investment (SRI-fund nature, we find that investee-firms' controversies diversely affect fund performance, depending on the controversy type. Furthermore, participants and managers of SRI pension and SRI mutual funds display a passive behavior toward controversies. These attitudes are consistent with enduring behavior and continuity investment policies, such as amending/controlling CSR-firm controversies. In contrast, conventional pension-fund and conventional mutual-fund participants seem guided by traditional investment rules to deal with unsatisfactory situations and respond to controversies after managerial decisions regarding these events with negative reactions. Finally, firms developing CSR-engagement strategies may soften market and managerial reactions toward controversies. Nonetheless, symbolic CSR-engagement practices arouse participants' responses.

It is important for organizations to identify the drivers for effective collaboration in contemporary teams, such as self-managed ad hoc teams. Therefore, we aimed to investigate (1) the influence of team task engagement and mastery experiences on collective efficacy beliefs and (2) the temporal relationship between team task engagement and task performance over time. We postulate that to build collective efficacy in contemporary teams over time, it is necessary to enhance positive emotional states (i.e., team task engagement) and mastery experiences (teams' past task performance). The study adopted a three-wave longitudinal design in which 575 individuals nested within 112 self-managed ad hoc teams participated in a decision-making task. Results showed that team task engagement and past task performance positively predicted future collective efficacy. Moreover, team task engagement positively predicted teams' task performance over time. This study contributes to the understanding of the antecedents of team effectiveness, specifically in contemporary teams.JEL CLASSIFICATION: C92;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1177/2340944420929706;How do emerging market SMEs utilize resources in the face of environmental uncertainty?. Using the resource-based view of the firm, this article examines how different resources are used by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in response to environmental uncertainty in an emerging market context. A survey was conducted involving 212 owners, CEOs, or managing directors of SMEs in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to explore the drivers of firm growth strategies. Our empirical results show that higher environmental uncertainty, in terms of market and regulatory uncertainty, drives SMEs to pursue a more exploratory instead of an exploitative growth strategy. Our results also show that SMEs pursuing more of an exploratory growth strategy focus predominantly on intangible resources such as human capital and social capital while firms pursuing more of an exploitative growth strategy focus more on financial resources. The results from our study provide valuable insights for how managers can structure, bundle, and leverage different resources for developing their strategies based on their level of perceived environmental uncertainty. The policy implications from our study are that support for SMEs should be multi-faceted depending on the combination of uncertainty faced and type of strategy chosen by SMEs.

10.1177/23409444211007487;The role of national culture as a lens for stakeholder evaluation of corporate social performance and its effect on corporate reputation. Studies have shown that corporate social performance (CSP) is an antecedent of corporate reputation, acting as a signal that affects stakeholders' perceptions and expectations about a firm's future behavior. However, the perceptions, expectations, and interests of stakeholders may be affected by external factors, such as national culture, which shapes their beliefs about what role companies play in society. Drawing on institutional theory and Hofstede's cultural dimensions, we analyze how stakeholders' national culture moderates the relationship between CSP and corporate reputation. The results of the analysis of an international sample for the period 2010 to 2016 show that low individualism (i.e., collectivism), low masculinity (i.e., femininity), low power distance, and low uncertainty avoidance intensify the positive relationship between CSP and corporate reputation.JEL CLASSIFICATION: M14, L14;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Throughout history, societies have been beset by disasters that took them by surprise, often with widespread and devastating consequences. When crops, animals, or people began dying with unusual frequency, especially when the causes were not observable, people often failed to respond, responded very slowly, or responded in surprisingly misdirected ways. In this essay, we focus on the role of leadership in addressing or failing to address such crises, paying special attention to the responses to the Covid-19 crisis during 2020. Our central thesis is that leadership hubris was a central (though not the only) culprit in poor responses, and we introduce the problem of inaction as a symptom of hubris. We conclude with some reflections for practitioners and researchers, suggesting a few areas worthy of examination to better understand how societies and business organizations may construct defenses against the dangers of leadership hubris.JEL CLASSIFICATION M14;art;" N00"",art";;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Motivated by the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm, this study explores whether mergers and acquisitions (M&As) can facilitate or impede a firm's marketing capabilities. Furthermore, this study also examines whether the influence of M&As on a firm's marketing capabilities is conditional to the type of deals, that is, domestic versus cross-border acquisitions. Using the difference-in-differences research design with a large sample of 15,509 firm-year observations for 898 US public acquirers, this study tests the postacquisition changes in a firm's marketing capabilities as reflected in the sensitivity of sales revenue to marketing-related expenditure. The results of the empirical tests show a postacquisition increase in sales sensitivity, suggesting that firms can enhance their marketing capabilities through M&As. However, it is also found that the enhancement in marketing capabilities is limited to domestic M&As and disappears for cross-border acquisitions. This result suggests that more salient differences in a firm's marketing environment attributable to cross-border acquisitions may disrupt a firm's marketing capabilities and dampen the positive effect of M&As.

Although the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm is one of the most accepted theories of strategic management, it has been criticized for its limited empirical support. The RBV basically predicts the relationship between the firm's resources and its performance. This study argues that it is more appropriate to measure firm performance using profit efficiency than traditional financial or accounting measures and that frontier models have great potential in empirical research on the RBV. To test this idea empirically, we used a stochastic frontier model with random coefficients to evaluate the impact of corporate reputation on profit efficiency. Finally, implications of the aforementioned focal points are discussed.JEL classification: C11, L25, M10, M20;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This article investigates the relationship between Inter-Korean geopolitical risk (IKGPR) and South Korean firms' risk-taking in the context of highly political tensions in the Korean peninsula. Using a recently developed news-based index of geopolitical risk, our empirical analysis shows an inverse U-shaped relationship between IKGPR and firm risk-taking in South Korea, implying that South Korean firms' risk-taking increases with IKGPR when IKGPR is low but becomes prudent when IKGPR is high. Such an effect of IKGPR on firm risk-taking is weaker for firms that survive wartime (1900-1969) and is stronger for firms that were established after the Second Korean War (1966-1969), suggesting the role of corporate resilience to geopolitical risk in motivating differences in corporate behaviors. Further analyses indicate that South Korean firms tend to take less risk when the nuclear risk is higher and when they are more technology-oriented.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The often long-lasting process of intrafamily business succession involves contracts for management and ownership transfer that unfold in a complex series of stages. The older and larger a family business, the more heterogeneous the involved family members' interactions and interests can become. These differences become obvious in the succession process. Also, in entrepreneurial families, information is not easy to obtain and is neither perfect nor unlimited, for example, with regard to expectations regarding the duration or the type of business succession. Information asymmetries can arise. This article investigates the drivers of information asymmetries and provides insight into the current research by investigating information asymmetries and their impact during different phases of intrafamily business succession. Data from 215 German firms reveal the occurrence of specific information asymmetries during different phases of intrafamily business succession. JEL CLASSIFICATION M1;art;" L2"",art";;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Analyzing the role of reputation for social performance in cross-border acquisitions. The social performance (SP) of a firm is associated with many positive organizational outcomes. Nonetheless, little is known about the effect of the SP of a multinational enterprise (MNE) on the likelihood of cross-border acquisition completion (CBAC). Investigating the link between MNEs' SP and the likelihood of CBAC is important because it will increase our understanding of how stakeholders reward MNEs with better reputations. Drawing on the signaling and reputation for SP literature, we explore how acquisition complexity, reputational risk, and firm visibility influence CBAC. Based on a sample of 578 cross-border deals undertaken by acquirers in the noncyclical consumer industry (NCCI), our results support a positive relationship between MNEs' SP and the likelihood of CBAC and strengthening moderating effects of acquirer size and public targets.

10.1177/2340944420916101;CSR and battered women: Stakeholder engagement beyond salience?. The use of salience as a tool to determine which stakeholders matter may lead to the marginalization of some stakeholder groups. As a normative theory, salience is problematic because it uproots stakeholder theory from its moral foundations. As a descriptive theory, its prevalence has found mixed support in literature. In order to overcome these limitations, scholars have recommended grounding stakeholder theory in ethics of care. These recommendations have largely been normative but still lack empirical support. We present the case of Escuela Social Ana Bella to show that, particularly when dealing with marginalized stakeholders, stakeholder theory rooted in ethics of care has considerable explanatory power. We find that firms can engage with fringe stakeholders when the decisions of managers are informed by emotions. We also find that this engagement can have the power to transform the beneficiary stakeholder group to an extent where they may become, paradoxically, salient stakeholders for the firm.JEL CLASSIFICATION: M14;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This article studies how the choice of the mechanism of governance affects online ratings of hotels, empirically exploring the conditions under which various governance mechanisms improve (or damage) them. We emphasize that no governance mode is universally superior. However, when the mechanism of governance fits hotel characteristics, online ratings improve. We argue that such characteristics (i.e., hotel category, size, and age) determine the severity of agency problems (e.g., managerial shirking and free-riding) and the performance of governance choice. We test several organizational fit hypotheses on a data set of 2,328 hotels operating in Spain. Our results support the fit argument, because they show the superiority of franchise and management contracts (i.e., hybrids) for enhancing online ratings, as opposed to vertical integration, when category rises and size increases. Furthermore, we find evidence that maintenance does not appear to be a major problem in leasing. JEL CLASSIFICATION: D23;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We consider a set of potential determinants of success, which are theoretically well-grounded and cover a variety of spheres related to project features. Results suggest that factors related to the signaling theories such as partnership, having previous experience and interaction with backers are positively associated with the achievement ratio, whereas no significant impact is found for the number of rewards.

10.1108/PR-08-2023-0700;Talent philosophies and institutional factors as determinants of talent management in SMEs: a French country-specific empirical investigation. Purpose - Talent management (TM) is a crucial strategic issue for global organizations, extending beyond multinationals and big companies to encompass small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and contexts outside the Anglo-Saxon sphere. However, TM in SMEs is still under-researched, with a lack of studies and evidence on TM determinants and TM in practice. This study explores, using the lens of institutional theory, how talent philosophies and a combination of institutional factors shape TM in French SMEs, highlighting the interplay between these elements within the specific context of French SMEs. Design/methodology/approach - Given the limited knowledge about TM determinants in SMEs and the need to uncover and understand the phenomenon investigated, this study is exploratory in nature and lends itself to a qualitative research approach. In-depth semi-structured interviews with 27 CEOs, managers, TM and HR managers across 15 SMEs in France provided a comprehensive cross-industry perspective. Findings - The study reveals that talent philosophies in French SMEs are predominantly inclusive and development-oriented, influenced by institutional factors such as the cultural logic of proximity and personalization, state support mechanisms like the Fonds Unique Interministeriel ( FUI) and legal frameworks that emphasize equal opportunity. Organizational elements like size and proximity foster a community-focused, egalitarian TM approach, while ownership and vulnerability lead to a reactive and informal TM strategy. The study presents a model that links these determinants to the specific TM approaches observed in French SMEs, illustrating how institutional factors like centralized control and egalitarianism shape TM practices. Research limitations/implications - This paper highlights the need for more empirical studies on talent philosophies, institutional and organizational factors not only in SMEs but also in comparison with multinational enterprises (MNEs), through institutional theory. Particular attention should be paid to the homogenization of SME sizes based on their level of establishment. Originality/value - This study extends studies on TM determinants in SMEs, from the perspective of talent philosophies, utilizing insights from French institutional theory. It is also among the few and new studies to highlight contextual issues of TM as well as how TM is practiced depending on internal and external factors.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

PurposeNumerous studies have shown that minority workers are disadvantaged in the labour market due to stereotypes and discrimination. However, published research on resume screening has overlooked the effects of multiple social categorisations pertaining to candidates' gender, education and origin. This study addresses this gap and examines whether the gender, the level of education and the national origin cues mentioned in the resume affect the perceived employability of candidates.Design/methodology/approachThis study employs an experimental between-subjects factorial design in that 12 resumes varying in gender, education and national origin were rated by 373 Portuguese working adults.FindingsThe results documented a gender premium as women were favoured in interpersonal and job skills but not in job suitability, and an education premium, since higher educated candidates were preferred despite their gender and origin. No meaningful interactions for gender x education x national origin were observed, which suggests that ingroup favouritism and outgroup discrimination in resume screening can be averted.Originality/valueThe findings endorse a multidimensional view of perceived employability by investigating candidates' skills and job suitability from the viewpoint of the decision-makers, which extends our understanding of resume-screening discrimination.

The authors explore the experience of mothers, of how digital peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms can affect their self-perceived employability and skills deterioration by unlocking human capital through technology acceptance. Design/methodology/approach This study adopted a pragmatism-based approach incorporating using a single-case study research design with the Gioia methodology. It utilised a semi-structured telephone survey to collect data to explore the decisions around usage of a newly developed mobile P2P app, aiming to support employability among mothers. Analysis was conducted inductively using thematic analysis and partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Findings The study finds that mothers experience high rates of continued labour market attachment on a casual or part-time basis, difficulty in juggling family and work, and high levels of concern both about future employment/entrepreneurial opportunities and expected stress in balancing dual roles of carer and earner. While mothers are interested in using new sharing economy technologies to reduce skills deterioration and improve signalling, the authors find that there were both technology and non-technology related barriers. These included trust and security, life-stage mismatch, time poverty and limitation of service offerings. Research limitations/implications This research was limited to mothers in one state in Australia and by the case study research design, the measurement model and the self-report nature of the data collection. Hence, the findings may lack generalisability in other contexts. It also limits the ability to make conclusions regarding causality. Originality/value This exploratory study contributes to research in the intersection between human resources (HR) and entrepreneurship by illustrating how sharing economy platforms can offer women a means to overcome the issues of signalling and skills deterioration in relation to aspects of human capital theory by developing new skills that may act as positive signals signal to potential employers or investors. Additionally, the social interactions between mothers, through technology adoption, can provide a basis for improving future self-employment or entrepreneurship and employability.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Purpose As the work context is dynamically changing, enhancing employee engagement through personal and organizational means is still capturing the attention of organizations as well as human resources researchers and practitioners. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to examine the relationships between self-leadership, employee engagement, and perceived organizational support and to test the moderating effect of perceived organizational support. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected through an online self-reporting questionnaire, with a total of 225 employees from Lebanon and 251 employees from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Moderating analysis was conducted using Process v3.3 on both samples. Findings Results have shown that self-leadership and perceived organizational support were positively related to employee engagement in both countries. However, perceived organizational support served to enhance self-leadership and employee engagement in the UAE, but not in Lebanon. Practical implications The findings of this study can be used to help organizations as well as human resources and regional managers operating in the Middle East in giving insights about investing in self-leadership strategies and positively influence employee perception of organizational support to strengthen employee engagement. Originality/value This study is unique in exploring the moderating role of perceived organizational support on the relationship between self-leadership and engagement, and original in theoretically proposing and empirically examining the interaction between perceived organizational support and self-leadership.

Purpose The aim of this study is to explore and unpack the notion of lateral voice within the context of a Chinese hospital. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative design was used, involving interviews of 24 medical personnel from a public hospital in mainland China. This included two focus groups (eight participants each) of physicians and nurses, and eight individual interviews with managers, including a chief nurse and directors of the medical centre. Findings The findings reveal that in top-down contexts with a respect for hierarchy, direct and vertical voice is discouraged but lateral voice fills this gap and can lead in some circumstances to a pathway to collective vertical voice. Interestingly, the study finds that fear of damaging relationships with peers may also discourage lateral voice in some cases, leading to silence altogether. Contradictory lateral voice outcomes arising from employees working within this context are discussed. Originality/value The study makes an original contribution to voice literature through exploring an understudied voice target, that is, voicing to peers. In doing so, the study demonstrates the importance of lateral voice as an important component of voice behaviour.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Purpose Drawing upon social influence theory, this study examines employee voice as one potential form of social influence that enables employees to receive positive performance evaluations from their supervisors, further increasing their chances of being promoted to a higher positional level. Importantly, organizational politics as experienced by employees is an important boundary condition that may affect the success of voice in achieving promotability. Design/methodology/approach This study obtained data from 218 independent matched subordinate-supervisor dyads from a manufacturing company in Japan. This study utilized the PROCESS macro developed by Hayes (2013) to test moderated mediation hypotheses. Findings Employee voice positively predicts employee promotability through supervisors' evaluations of employee task performance, and organizational politics operates as a boundary condition at both the first and second stages of moderation. Practical implications By speaking up at work, employees may instill an impression as a highly performing and competent individual in the eyes of their supervisors, thereby increasing their chances of being promoted within their organization. However, it is important to carefully consider the degree of workplace politics before expressing one's voice. For organizations, it is important to ensure that the policies and procedures used to demine promotion decisions are objective.

Findings The analyses show that only one facet of OC- affective commitment and the alignment and action-orientation dimensions of EE positively affect OCB. The relationship between OC and OCB is fully mediated by EE. Practical implications The results imply that engaging employees is pivotal for effectively fostering citizenship behavior among employees. Organizations should be willing to implement strategies and interventions which enhance the emotional experience of employees to foster a sense of belongingness with the organization and engage them. Originality/value The paper draws on a unique data set of a prestigious organization in India to provide insights with substantial degree of generalizability into the relationship between OC, OCB and EE, whilst applying a comprehensive definition of these constructs. It is the first study to examine the inter-relationship among different facets of these constructs.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2021-0014;Development and validation of multi-factor employee engagement measuring instrument: a formative measurement model. Purpose The purpose of this study is to bring about an exhaustive measurement instrument of employee engagement and validate the same in Indian settings. Design/methodology/approach This descriptive and cross-sectional study initiates with reviewing the available literature in the field of employee engagement to identify factors affecting and the corresponding items defining them. Following the discussion with experts and industry professionals, an instrument was, thus, obtained to administer the primary data from employees working in public and private power companies in India. The study used Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) 3 to demonstrate employee engagement as a first-order reflective and second-order formative construct. Thereafter, reliability and convergent validity were assessed to validate the instrument. Findings This paper conceptualized employee engagement as a multi-factor construct (nine in numbers). The factors are Respect, Supervisor's support and recognition, Growth and development, Creative and challenging job, Job significance, Perceived self-worth, performance evaluation and recognition and Organizational bureaucracy. These factors are exhaustive and collectively define employee engagement. Distortion or omission in any of these items may distort the nature of construct as well. Originality/value Previous studies have defined the concept of employee engagement as unidimensional and thus observe serious lacunas. This study identified employee engagement as a multi-factor construct that incorporates the exhaustive nature of the organizational setting. Not only this study adds value to the existing body of knowledge in the field of employee engagement but also specify the measurement model as a formative one concerning employee engagement.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-08-2019-0443;Does job stress enhance employee creativity? Exploring the role of psychological capital. Purpose Using the conservation of resource theory, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the potentially positive influence of job stress on creativity through the resource caravan approach. The influence of job stress directly and as a moderator of psychological capital (PsyCap) is explored. Finally, the influence of stress on creativity is investigated as a boundary condition that impacts on the PsyCap-creativity relationship via job satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach Relationships were tested on two samples: (1) an international employee cohort (n = 269) and (2) a New Zealand employee sample (n = 475) and similar effects were found in both studies. Findings PsyCap was found to influence job satisfaction and creativity, with job satisfaction partially mediating this direct effect. Job stress has a positive moderation effect with PsyCap toward creativity, supporting Conservation of Resources theory, which suggests that high PsyCap individuals would have the psychological resources to leverage stress beneficially, making their behaviors more creative. Significant moderated mediation effects indicate complex indirect effects with PsyCap on creativity (via job satisfaction) increasing as job stress gets higher. Practical implications This study calls for researchers' attention toward potentially positive influences of stress when considered in combination with high psychological resources. Practical implications focus manager's and leader's attention toward the enhancement of employees' psychological resources for its stress and creativity related benefits. Originality/value The findings provide new theoretical support for understanding how stress can positively influence creativity. The use of two samples improves confidence in these findings.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-11-2022-0752;Age-inclusive HR practices and older workers' voice behavior: the role of job crafting toward strengths and negative age-based metastereotypes. PurposeUsing signaling theory, the overarching purpose of this study is to provide an insight into how age-inclusive HR practices (AIHRP) influence older workers' voice behavior through job crafting toward strengths (JCS) and how negative age-based metastereotypes (NABM) moderate these relationships.Design/methodology/approachUsing time-lagged data were obtained from 321 Chinese older workers. PROCESS MACRO and Bootstrapping were used to test theoretical hypotheses.FindingsOur results revealed the positive effects of AIHRP on both JCS and voice behavior, and the positive effect of JCS on voice behavior, as well as the mediating role of JCS in the relationship between AIHRP and voice behavior. Besides, results also found that NABM negatively moderate the effect of AIHRP on voice behavior, and the effect of AIHRP on JCS. Additionally, significant moderated mediation effect indicates that the indirect effect of AIHRP on voice via JCS will be weaker for employees with higher NABM.Research limitations/implicationsFirst, we take the lead in linking AIHRP and employees' voice behavior. This complements voice literature by identifying an important new factor in motivating older workers' voice behavior. Second, by exploring the mediating role of JCS, we reveal the black box of how AIHRP affect older workers' voice behavior. Third, this study responds to the call for more studies exploring the boundary conditions of AIHRP and expands the theoretical research framework of the relationship between AIHRP, JCS and voice, deepens our understanding of the mechanism of voice behavior.Practical implicationsOur findings have several practical implications. First, the leadership personnel throughout the firm should be conscious of the crucial role of AIHRP. Second, managers should provide older workers with opportunities to craft their jobs to use their strengths and achieve a better person-job fit, which will result in a series of positive outcomes. Third, organizations should blur intergenerational boundaries within the organization and provide older workers with mentoring opportunities to motivate their voice.Social implicationsOur findings have some social implications. Firstly, the results of this study are beneficial in demonstrating to society that older workers still have significant strengths and value. With reasonable methods, older workers can continue to contribute to the development of organizations and society, which in turn is conducive to changing society's perceived bias toward older workers, reducing age discrimination and promoting social harmony. Secondly, this study provides theoretical guidance for organizations and society to manage older workers, which is conducive to alleviating social problems such as youth labor shortage and increased burden of retirement.Originality/valueThis study is innovative as it first explores the influence, mechanism and boundary conditions of AIHRP on older workers' voice behavior, which not only deepens our understanding of older workers voice, but also enriches the research on AIHRP and JCS.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2022-0087;When humor masks abuse: employee responses to abusive supervision through the lens of relational energy. PurposeDrawing on conservation of resources theory, this study aims to develop a resource-based model depicting a decreased level of psychological resourcefulness - relational energy, as a novel explanatory mechanism that accounts for the harm of abusive supervision, and we further investigate the role of leader humor as a boundary condition.Design/methodology/approachWe applied multilevel path analysis to test our hypotheses with three-time-point survey data collected from 226 supervisor-employee dyads in a telecommunication company in China across six months.FindingsOur results show that abusive supervision is negatively related to employee relational energy, leading to a subsequent decline in employee job performance. The predictions of the depleting effects get alleviated by leader humor.Practical implicationsThis study foregrounds the importance of employee relationship management in the workplace and reveals that some abusive supervisors may manage to sustain employee performance and relational energy by using humor in their interactions, which necessitates immediate intervention.Originality/valueThese findings offer novel insights into the deleterious impact of abusive supervision by demonstrating the critical role of relational energy in dyadic interactions. We also reveal the potential dark side of leader humor in the context of abuse in the workplace.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-12-2020-0894;Transactional leadership matters in green creative behaviour through workplace learning and green knowledge management: moderating role of social network sites use. PurposeThe purpose of this study is to investigate the predictive influence of transactional leadership on employee green creative behaviour (GCB) and the mediating role of workplace learning and green knowledge management (GKM) in this relationship. Based on the leader-member exchange (LMX) theory. This study also uses moderated mediation analysis to investigate social networking sites (SNS) use as a moderator to better understand the indirect relationship between transactional leadership and employee GCB.Design/methodology/approachThe data for this quantitative study were collected using a time-lag technique, with two time waves apart by two months. The final sample for the study included 294 employee-supervisor dyads from small and medium-sized tourism enterprises in the north eastern part of China.FindingsFindings supported the study's proposed hypotheses, indicating that transactional leadership has a significant impact on workplace learning and GKM, as well as a significant role of mediators (workplace learning and GKM) in the relationship between transactional leadership and employee GCB. Furthermore, SNS use significantly moderated the impact of both mediators in establishing a link between transactional leadership and employee GCB.Originality/valueThis study offers new perspectives and insights for entrepreneurs, decision-makers, academics and tourism sector experts by identifying and putting into practise the predictive role of transactional leadership in innovative behaviours. This study also suggests that small and mid-sized travel agencies should focus on workplace learning, GKM and SNS use to promote environment-friendly creative employee behaviour.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-12-2020-0891;Can patient gratitude compensate for depletion from family-to-work conflict in nurses? An experience sampling study. Purpose Nurses' work engagement is critical for the service quality of the hospital. Thus, investigation on the influencing factors of nurses' work engagement has become an important issue. This study addresses this issue by exploring the effect of daily family-to-work conflict (FWC) on next-day work engagement among Chinese nurses. Design/methodology/approach The theoretical model was tested using 555 experience sampling data from 61 nurses collected for 10 workdays in China. Findings Nurses' daily FWC is associated with their next-day ego depletion. Moreover, increased ego depletion ultimately reduces their next-day work engagement. In addition, a between-individual factor of frequency of perceived patient gratitude mitigates the effect of FWC on ego depletion and the indirect effect on work engagement via ego depletion. Originality/value This study is important to the management of health-care organizations as it carries significant implications for theory and practice toward understanding the influence of FWC among nurses. On the one hand, the authors apply the job demands-resources (JD-R) model as the overarching theoretical framework, which contributes to the authors' understanding of how FWC impairs work engagement. On the other hand, the authors extend extant theoretical models of FWC by identifying the frequency of perceived patient gratitude as an important contextual factor that counteracts the negative effects of FWC among nurses. Moreover, organizations could encourage patients to express their gratitude to nurses by providing more channels, such as thank-you notes, to offer nurses some support for overcoming the destructive effect of FWC.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Purpose This study examines the mediating role of the fairness of performance appraisal on the association between the extent of use of strategic performance measurement systems (SPMSs) with SPMS effectiveness. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected using an online survey distributed to 656 Australian middle and lower level managers. Findings The findings reveal that informational fairness mediates the association between SPMSs (link to value drivers and the use of multidimensional performance measures) with performance-related outcomes;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2019-0539;Multicultural skills in open innovation: relational leadership enabling knowledge sourcing and sharing. Purpose In this paper, the authors argue that multicultural skills and relational leadership act as enablers for open innovation, and thereby examine the process through which teams can utilize multicultural skills to support the development of relational leadership and knowledge sourcing and sharing (KSS) through individual interaction and relationship building. The authors address the following research question: How does relational leadership enable open innovation (OI) among employees with multicultural skills? Design/methodology/approach This paper applies a multi-level approach (team and individual level) and builds on interviews with 20 employees, middle and senior managers with multicultural experiences, working in open innovation environments. Findings The authors' findings shed light on the process through which social exchange relationships among team members (e.g. R&D teams) and knowledge exchange partners are enhanced by the use of multicultural skills and support the development of relational leadership to facilitate KSS and ultimately OI. The decision for participants to collaborate and source and share knowledge is motivated by individual reward (such as establishing network or long-lasting contacts), skill acquisition (such as learning or personal growth in decision-making) and a sense of reciprocity and drive for group gain. The authors encourage greater human resource (HR) manager support for relational leadership and the development and use of multicultural skills to promote KSS. Research limitations/implications Despite the value of our findings, this paper is not without limitations. The authors explained that the focus of this study design was on the work activities of the participants and their skill development and not specific projects or organizations. It was outside the scope of this study to examine variations across organizations and individuals as the authors wanted to focus on multicultural skills and relational leadership as enablers for OI. The authors recommend that future studies extend our research by unpacking how various boundary conditions including relational leadership and multicultural skills impact KSS and OI over the life cycle of innovation teams within large multinational organizations, across countries and ethnicities. Practical implications The study's findings provide managers with improved understandings of how to enable an individual's willingness and readiness to source and share knowledge through multicultural skills and relational leadership. Managers need to ensure that human resource management (HRM) practices celebrate multicultural skills and support relational leadership in innovation teams. The authors suggest managers engaged in OI consider the components of social exchange as described by Meeker (1971) and utilize reciprocity, group gain, rationality and status consistency to support the emergence relational leadership and KSS in innovation teams. Originality/value In this paper, the authors contribute to the dearth of literature on the boundary conditions for OI by examining the role of relational leadership and characteristics/skills of the workforce, namely multicultural skills and contribute to the scarce research on the role of employees with multicultural skills and their impact on OI and present multicultural skills/experiences and relational leadership as enablers for OI.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-11-2019-0638;Self-initiated expatriation and older women: composing a further life. Purpose Research into self-initiated expatriation (SIE) has increased exponentially, although the focus of these investigations has been on professional workers, and little has been gender specific. The purpose of this research therefore is to explore the career and personal motivations for SIE through the novel lens of older women. In this exploratory study, SIE and socio-emotional selectivity motivation theories (SSTs) are used, in addition to the Kaleidoscope Career Model (KCM), to understand the reasons these women have taken this path. Design/methodology/approach The paper employs a qualitative methodology, drawing on in-depth life story interviews with 21 women aged 50 or more who had taken a SIE. A five-step narrative process using a story-telling approach was the method of analysis. Findings The findings show important contradictions to the extant literature. Career dissatisfaction and escape are key motivations for these women. Further, contrary to SST, these women were seeking novelty-new places and new experiences. These women were also seeking authenticity as suggested by KCM, but also challenge was to the fore-not in the career domain, but in the personal domain. Their motivations for SIE extend beyond the current evidence base and understanding of the phenomena. Originality/value The contributions include new insights into the motivational drivers for SIE for these older women and the importance of timing as facilitators of SIE. The SIE nomenclature is broadened through the inclusion of older women and beyond professional spheres. An initial framework of a more integrated model is developed from this exploratory study and presented as a basis for beginning to understand the phenomenon of older women undertaking SIE.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2024-0467;Proactive personality and mental well-being among the working population: testing a moderated mediation model. PurposeMental health issues negatively affect employees' quality of life and employers' bottom line. Consequently, ensuring well-being in the workplace is becoming a high priority from a strategic human resource management perspective. Drawing on basic psychological needs theory, we propose that proactive personality will be related to mental well-being through satisfaction of basic psychological needs. In addition, drawing on the trait-by-trait interactions perspective, we expect the mediated relationship to be moderated by conscientiousness.Design/methodology/approachWe tested our research model using data collected from 185 employees using a three-wave time-lagged design.FindingsProactive personality related to mental well-being indirectly, via psychological need satisfaction, and this indirect relationship was stronger at higher levels of conscientiousness.Practical implicationsEnsuring mental well-being of employees is critical to achieving a competitive advantage. Support for the mediating role of need satisfaction suggests that organizations can tailor interventions aimed at influencing the more malleable mediating variable, psychological need satisfaction, compared to relatively stable personality traits.Originality/valueWe contribute to theory by testing a theoretical explanation for how and why personality affects mental well-being. Another theoretical contribution is demonstrating that mental well-being results from a combination of personality traits, with a trait-by-trait perspective fitting the data better than an unconditional trait model.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

PurposeWorking mothers experienced dramatic changes to their daily routines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many began to work from home as they simultaneously tried to balance work demands with tending to their children. The purpose of the current study was to examine working mothers' experiences during the pandemic.Design/methodology/approachIn order to examine working mothers' experiences of telework during the pandemic, we conducted a focus group study. 45 working mothers participated, and they answered questions about their experiences.FindingsThree themes emerged from the focus groups: (1) motivation shifts amongst working mothers;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2023-0103;Not your average candidate: overqualified job applicants in the eyes of hiring practitioners. PurposeEarly research on overqualification suggested that overqualification is primarily associated with negative attitudes and behavior. As a consequence, hiring practitioners were advised against hiring overqualified job applicants. However, recent studies have revealed that there are several potential positive consequences of overqualification. Given this change in perspective on overqualification, we examine how hiring practitioners nowadays look at overqualified job applicants, and what their considerations are for hiring an overqualified job applicant or not.Design/methodology/approachWe have interviewed 33 hiring practitioners to examine their attitudes and considerations toward hiring overqualified job applicants.FindingsResults show that hiring practitioners are aware of potential positive as well as negative consequences of overqualification and consider a variety of factors to assess how beneficial hiring an overqualified candidate will be. These factors fall under three categories: Individual considerations, interpersonal considerations and contextual considerations.Originality/valueWe show that overqualification is not a stigma anymore and that the decision to hire an overqualified job applicant or not depends on a mixture of factors that are carefully considered. Two of these three considerations transcend the individual level (i.e. the overqualified person), whereas most research and theories on the consequences of overqualification do not go beyond the individual level. As such, our findings call for more theory and research on interpersonal and contextual factors shaping the consequences of overqualification.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2023-0282;Mental health and expatriate psychological adjustment post-COVID: towards a new framework. PurposeThis paper aims to propose an expatriate psychological adjustment model that postulates expatriate mental health as an antecedent to psychological adjustment. It presents novel predeparture and post-arrival international human resource management (IHRM) expatriate management mental health supportive interventions.Design/methodology/approachThis paper critically reviews theoretical frameworks in the IHRM domain around expatriate psychological adjustments such as the U-Curve Adjustment Theory (Lysgaard, 1995), the Framework of International Adjustment (Black et al., 1991), the Dimensions of Expatriate Adjustment (Haslberger et al., 2013) and the Stress Outcome Model (Bader and Berg, 2014), in a quest to develop a new conceptual framework. This study presents a new conceptual framework along with propositions to take into consideration the relationship between mental health and expatriates' psychological adjustment.FindingsThe findings suggest that mental health is an antecedent paramount to psychological adjustment. The paper proposes mental health-supportive IHRM expatriate management interventions to address the potential failure of expatriates' psychological adjustment. The authors elaborate on the IHRM expatriate management policies and practices at the home and host country to ensure the mental health of company-assigned expatriates sent on international assignments.Originality/valueThe novel conceptual framework underpins mental health as the antecedent paramount to expatriate adjustment, taking into consid eration the elevated stress of situational events such as COVID-19, which had previously not received substantive formal consideration by research scholars in the IHRM domain. The conceptual framework encourages the inclusion of mental health as an antecedent in future research.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1108/PR-02-2021-0108;Intrinsic and extrinsic reward synergies for innovative work behavior among South African knowledge workers. Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether organizational support for innovation and informational extrinsic rewards moderate the relationship between intrinsic motivation and innovative work behavior. Design/methodology/approach Multiple and hierarchical regression analyses based on data from 150 knowledge workers tested the hypotheses for a South African sample. Findings The results confirmed a positive relationship between intrinsic motivation and innovative work behavior, and found positive relationships between both organizational support for innovation and informational extrinsic rewards and innovative work behavior. While organizational support positively moderated the relationship between intrinsic motivation and innovative work behavior, acting in synergy with intrinsic motivation, informational extrinsic rewards had a negative moderating effect. Practical implications When organizations want to encourage knowledge workers to generate, promote and realize innovative ideas, they should create an environment that encourages autonomy, competence and relatedness, with support for creativity and differences of ideas. Originality/value The study provides new indications of the interactions of synergistic extrinsic rewards and intrinsic motivation to affect innovative work behavior.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2021-0733;The link between supervisor support, servicing efficacy and job satisfaction among frontline hotel employees: an investigation in Turkey. Purpose This paper aims to examine the association between supervisor support, servicing efficacy and job satisfaction among frontline hotel employees in Turkey. Specifically, the mediating role of servicing efficacy was examined in the link between supervisor support and job satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 421 frontline employees in 4- and 5-star hotels located in the South and South West of Turkey. The authors proposed a conceptual model in which servicing efficacy mediates the link between supervisor support and job satisfaction after controlling for demographic information. Data were analyzed through the structural equation modeling (SEM) framework. Findings Results showed that supervisor support positively predicted servicing efficacy and job satisfaction reports of the employees. Those reporting higher servicing efficacy were more likely to report increased job satisfaction. In addition, servicing efficacy partially mediated the link between supervisor support and job satisfaction. Originality/value The current study provides new evidence on the link between supervisor support, efficacy beliefs and job satisfaction in the hotel industry. This is the first study investigating the mediating role of servicing efficacy in the association between supervisor support and job satisfaction. Moreover, most previous studies separately focusing on supervisor support, efficacy beliefs and job satisfaction in the hospitality industry were conducted in developed, Western countries. In contrast, research examining work-related constructs and outcomes in Turkey's hospitality industry has been limited. Thus, both replicated and original findings would contribute to the generalizability of cumulative knowledge in tourism and hospitality.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2021-0103;Job attitudes and career behaviors relating to employees' perceived incorporation of artificial intelligence in the workplace: a career self-management perspective. Purpose Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to be deployed in workplaces. While there are many positive outcomes of AI integration, understanding the extent of its consequences on employees is limited. Hence, this study examines employee perceptions of AI and the consequent influences on employee job attitudes and career behaviors. Utilizing the career self-management perspective, the authors explore the mechanisms related to employee perceptions of AI and potential career exploration behaviors. Design/methodology/approach The authors tested several hypotheses using employee survey data (N = 345 call center agents) collected from a firm that recently integrated AI in their operations. The authors collected data on four occasions (one-week intervals between data collection) to determine employee perceptions of AI taking over jobs (Time 1);art;" and career exploration behavior (Time 4). Findings The findings reveal that perceptions of AI taking over jobs are significantly associated with higher career exploration behaviors. In addition, the authors found job insecurity and psychological distress as pathways that explain why employees having perceptions of AI taking over their jobs influences their career exploration behaviors. Originality/value These findings fill a gap in the literature by revealing how AI integration in the workplace, despite its many positive outcomes for organizations, can have a negative influence on employees. The negative employee perceptions of AI can lead to career exploration behaviors. From the career self-management perspective, the authors offer novel insights that have practical implications for talent management, particularly the need to communicate effectively to employees about AI integration in the workplace to avoid them feeling threatened and leaving their jobs."",art";;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-07-2019-0353;Perceived managerial intimidation: harmful implications and potential buffers. Purpose Does perceived managerial intimidation result in harmful emotional and behavioral implications that impair employees' performance? If so, are there buffers against these implications? To answer these questions, the current study relies on the social exchange theory and presents a moderated mediation model in which (1) perceived managerial intimidation evokes hostility that results in both organizational counterproductive work behavior (O-CWB) and interpersonal counterproductive work behavior (I-CWB) and (2) negative affectivity, political skill, tenure with the manager and sectorial affiliation moderate these relationships. Design/methodology/approach The moderated mediation model was tested using a sample of 367 subordinates. The data were collected in three waves. Findings Perceived managerial intimidation was positively related to hostility and both forms of CWB. Moreover, hostility mediated the relationships between perceived managerial intimidation and these two outcomes and sectorial affiliation moderated these mediations. Practical implications Public organizations should implement training programs to develop the awareness of the organizations' managers about the harmful implications of perceived managerial intimidation and teach the managers acceptable methods for improving employees' performance. Originality/value This study investigates whether perceived managerial intimidation results in CWB. The study's findings demonstrate positive relationships between these variables, shedding light on the emotional mediating mechanism that links the variables. Moreover, the study validates sectorial affiliation as a buffer against the negative emotional and behavioral implications of perceived managerial intimidation, providing ideas for practical implications.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2021-0062;A balanced perspective on the affordance of a gamified HRM system for employees' creative performance. Purpose Rather than overstating the favorable effects of gamification on work outcomes, the purpose of this paper is to present a more balanced perspective into the effects a gamified human resource management (HRM) system may have on creativity at work. This conceptual paper explores and delineates how employees' interaction with gamification features within a gamified HRM system enables and particularly undermines employees' motivation for workplace creative performance. Design/methodology/approach The cross-disciplinary nature of this paper necessitates the reliance on theoretical principles, the explanatory and predictive capacities of theories central to human-computer interaction, employee motivation and creativity fields. Thus, the tenets of affordance, self-determination and dynamic componential theory were utilized to analyze the affordance of a gamified HRM system for employees' creative outcomes. Findings It is discovered that augmenting the HRM system with gamification affordance is crucial amid global market change and increasing digitization. However, incorporating game design elements into work systems does not necessarily guarantee an increase in creative outcomes. On the contrary, the system may equally undermine employees' motivation, which in turn hampers their creative outcomes. Originality/value Many gamification papers have more often than not touted the positive effects of such a system on the targeted outcome. Based on the affordance theory which shows that a user's interaction with gamification properties could produce different outcomes (not only favorable ones) and considering the intricacies of employees' motivation and behavioral outcomes at work, this paper takes a more balanced perspective to examine how gamification could generate intended as well as unintended consequences for employees' creativity, which is crucial to overall job performance.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2021-0050;How do work-life support practices impact bank employees' subjective well-being?. Purpose Based on the social exchange theory, the paper aims to explore the effects of work-life support (WLS) practices on subjective well-being through work engagement and job satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach Data of 332 bank employees were collected in three waves and analyzed using AMOS and PROCESS macro. Findings The study revealed that WLS practices influenced employees' subjective well-being both directly and indirectly. The study's results further supported the serial mediation of the indirect effect through work engagement and job satisfaction. Practical implications Organizational WLS practices are supposed to play an effective role in helping employees increase subjective well-being. Organizations should attach importance to implementing WLS practices to ensure that employees are engaged and satisfied. Furthermore, organizations should undertake and communicate favorable WLS practices to stimulate employees' work and non-work well-being. Originality/value The study is the first that examines the impact of WLS practices on employees' subjective well-being. Furthermore, the study offers novel insights regarding the dual mediation effect of work engagement and job satisfaction in the relationship between WLS practices and subjective well-being.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2021-0301;Cultivating organizational attraction: a resource view on psychological contracts of career development among interns. Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between psychological contracts and subsequent internship outcomes, with a specific focus on employer obligations with regard to career development. The study also examines the potential moderating role of person-organization (P-O) fit. Design/methodology/approach Online surveys were administered to 196 college students both prior to and upon completing their summer internships. Moderated mediation analyses were performed following Hayes (2018). Findings The results show that employer fulfillment of career development is positively associated with organizational attractiveness, as mediated by intern skill acquisition. In addition, high levels of P-O fit ameliorated low developmental situations, with high P-O fit resulting in stronger attraction to the organization than low P-O fit. Practical implications The study underlines the importance of career development and the associated attainment of instrumental resources in the psychological contract process between organizations and interns. For the former, the provision of career development may increase interns' attraction to the organization. For interns, such opportunities can enhance skill acquisition, with differential effects for those with high and low P-O fit. Originality/value This study is the first to provide an empirical assessment of the instrumental outcomes of psychological contract fulfillment with regard to career development prior to formal organizational entry. It further sheds light on the interactive effect of skill acquisition and P-O fit in predicting individual perceptions of the organization.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2021-0404;Stakeholder engagement in inclusive employability management for employees whose health at work is impaired: empirical evidence from a French public organisation. Purpose This paper identifies the stakeholders engaged in inclusive employability management for employees whose health at work is impaired and examines how different mechanisms can be used to engage these stakeholders. The paper aims to explore the link between stakeholder engagement and inclusive employability management. Design/methodology/approach The empirical study uses a qualitative approach to mobilise a case study in a French public organisation. Data collection combines four sources: 50 individual interviews, informal dialogues, 39 days of observations and 43 documents. Findings The findings provide insights into the management of inclusive employability for vulnerable employees and reveal the multiplicity of stakeholders involved. Institutional, organisational and individual mechanisms are used to engage stakeholders in employability management for vulnerable employees. Furthermore, the implementation of inclusive structural and operational mechanisms promotes a policy that favours employability management. However, stakeholders are also faced with institutional, organisational and individual difficulties that limit their engagement. Practical implications The findings have the potential to inform organisational stakeholders - human resources management (HRM) and managerial stakeholders in particular - of the support needed for employability management. The findings emphasise the value of ensuring that employability management policies and practices promote the full integration of vulnerable employees. Originality/value The research fills an important gap in the HRM literature on managing employability for vulnerable employees. In doing so, the study makes a specific contribution to the literature on organisational inclusion with employability management. Our research contributes to extant knowledge of stakeholder engagement by including a bottom-up dimension to facilitate stakeholder engagement.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-07-2021-0535;Understanding the development of a common social identity between expatriates and host country nationals. Purpose This article examines the impact of expatriates' interaction adjustment and conducive work environment (i.e. trust, shared vision and intercultural communication) on the development of a common social identity between expatriates and host country nationals (HCNs) using the social identity theory (SIT). It also investigates whether increased trust, shared vision and intercultural communication mediate the relationship between expatriates' interaction adjustment and development of a common social identity. Design/methodology/approach Dyadic data were collected from 93 Chinese expatriates and 239 Pakistani HCNs using a three-wave time-lag design. A multilevel model was estimated using Bayesian estimation technique in the Mplus software. Findings Empirical evidence suggests an inverse relationship between expatriates' interaction adjustment and the development of a common social identity between expatriates and HCNs. Further, trust and intercultural communication led to a positive impact on the group memberships between expatriates and HCNs. However, no support was found regarding the mediating role of trust, shared vision and intercultural communication in this empirical research. Originality/value The existing literature focuses mainly on change experiences of expatriates during international assignments. However, the current study goes beyond this and investigates the individualized change experiences of HCNs. Further, empirical evidence in this research found a negative relationship between expatriates' interaction adjustment and the development of a common social identity between expatriates and HCNs, which needs to be examined further.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2021-0723;Subtle workplace discrimination inhibiting workers with intellectual disability from thriving at the workplace. Purpose The purpose of the article is to examine the experiences of workers with intellectual disability (WWID) and subtle discriminatory practices that hold these workers back from thriving at the workplace. Design/methodology/approach The research design employs the Shore et al. (2011) framework of inclusion supported by optimal distinctiveness theory (ODT) (Brewer, 1991). These theoretical frames are used to examine the potential for WWID to become members of a work group and experience the opportunity to develop their unique selves, negotiate and thrive through their work for purposeful career outcomes. A qualitative case study approach was adopted through interviews and focus groups with a total of 91 participants: 41 WWID, 5 human resource (HR) managers, 5 duty/department managers (DMs), 24 colleagues and 16 supervisors. Findings The authors found that enhancing inclusion is underpinned by the positive impact of human resource management (HRM) practices and line management support for WWID feelings of belongingness and uniqueness that enable them to thrive through their work activities. The authors demonstrate that WWID need manager support and positive social interactions to increase their learning and vitality for work to embrace opportunities for growth. However, when WWID do not have these conditions, there are fewer opportunities for them to thrive at the workplace. Practical implications There is a need for formal HRM and management support and inclusive organisational interventions to mitigate discriminatory practices and better support WWID at work. There is an opportunity for HRM to design training and development around belongingness and uniqueness for this cohort of workers to maximise WWID opportunities to thrive through their work. Originality/value This study examines a cohort of WWID who are often forgotten and subtly discriminated against more so than other minority or vulnerable cohorts in the workplace, especially in terms of their development and reaching their full potential at work, which has an impact on their ability to thrive through their work. The paper makes an innovative contribution to the HRM literature through unpacking the processes through which Shore et al.'s (2011) conceptualisation of belongingness and uniqueness contributes to thriving for a marginalised and often overlooked cohort of workers.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1108/PR-11-2019-0642;Relationship of perceived supervisor support, self-efficacy and turnover intention, the mediating role of burnout. Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of two positive organizational factors: the perceived supervisor support (PSS) and the self-efficacy (SE) on nurses' burnout (BO), which concurrently affect the turnover intention (TI) and the mediating role of BO in this relationship. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional survey-based study of a sample of 552 Lebanese registered nurses from 19 Lebanese hospitals was conducted. Findings The authors' findings confirm that PSS and SE both reduce the level of BO and the turnover intention significantly. The higher the perceived supervisors' support and the nurses' SE, the less they experience BO. BO has partially mediated the relationship of the PSS and SE on TI. This study reveals that supervisors' support is well perceived by Lebanese nurses, whose s is relatively high, while their levels of BO are considered moderate. However, BO levels vary proportionally with demographic variables, namely age, work experience, gender, marital status and education. Originality/value This study provides new evidence on the relationship between PSS, SE and BO and turnover intention of Lebanese nurses. It is unique in studying the role of nurses' SE with regard to BO and TI and improving the quality of nurses' work life. It shows the significance of the supervisors' role in supporting the psychological state of nurses. The context of the study, Lebanon, is also novel as it differs from advanced economies institutionally, culturally and in legal frameworks that govern the employee-supervisor relationships.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-12-2019-0708;The role of ethical leadership in enhancing exploitative and explorative learning simultaneously: what does it matter if employees view work as central?. Purpose The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that ethical leadership positively contributes to exploitative learning and explorative learning simultaneously and then examine the moderating role of work centrality in the relationships of ethical leadership with exploitative learning and explorative learning. Design/methodology/approach Time-lagged survey data were collected from 257 middle managers and their 257 immediate supervisors in 76 firms in China. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling and Hayes' PROCESS macro for SPSS. Findings The results revealed that ethical leadership positively contributed to exploitative learning and explorative learning simultaneously. Importantly, the authors found that work centrality strengthened the positive relationships of ethical leadership with both exploitative learning and explorative learning. Practical implications The findings can help organizations enhance exploitative learning and explorative learning simultaneously and enable them to gain a sustainable competitive advantage. Originality/value Although explorative learning and exploitative learning together constitute fundamental resources for organizations' long-term success, prior research has not looked into whether and when leader behaviors facilitate explorative learning and exploitative learning simultaneously. The study contributed to fill this gap by introducing ethical leadership, signifying its positive role in enhancing both explorative learning and exploitative learning, and establishing work centrality as a moderator to reinforce these two positive relationships.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2020-0372;Knowledge sharing, knowledge transfer and SMEs: evolution, antecedents, outcomes and directions. Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to systematically synthesize the extant literature of knowledge sharing (KS) and knowledge transfer (KT) in the small and medium enterprise (SME) context and to contribute with predictions of emerging themes.Design/methodology/approach - Applied is a systematic literature review using three bibliometric techniques: (1) textual analysis for keywords and abstracts to identify the research hotspots, (2) co-citation analysis of references to identify the evolution of KS and KT in SME and (3) bibliographic coupling analysis of documents to synthesize antecedents and outcomes.Findings - A conceptual map emerges from the review to reveal the antecedents of KS and KT at the individual, group and organizational levels. The analysis shows the strategic importance of KS and KT for the SME context. Specific findings include: (1) KS and KT are involved in enhancing SMEs strategic focus for human resources, including organizational learning, customer relations, creativity, higher profit and positive effects on operational processes and decision-making. (2) Innovation, trust and performance are identified as central human factors linked to KS and KT in SMEs. (3) Human resource (HR) management research could contribute to KS and KT in the SME domain by exploring KS- and KT-based practices, linking the emergence of innovation and innovative behaviors to these practices, leading to a better understanding of strategies that enable the long-term storage and retrieval of tacit and explicit knowledge as organizational memory in the SME context.Originality/value - This paper is one of the first to systematically review KS and KT in SMEs and propose a concept map. The research adds value to the growing literature of KS and KT and exposes the need for more specific activities to support SME managers, as well as HR managers, who need to facilitate KS and KT in SMEs.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22210;Does one size fit all? The role of job characteristics in cultivating work passion across knowledge, blue-collar, nonprofit, and managerial work. We integrate the job characteristics and dual work passion models to explore the indirect (via work meaningfulness) effects of job characteristics (i.e., job autonomy, task identity, skill variety, task significance, feedback from the job and feedback from others) on two types of work passion, harmonious passion (HP) and obsessive passion (OP). We first advance occupation-specific predictions for job characteristics-to-work passion relationships and then explore differences in those relationships between HP and OP across four occupational sectors: knowledge work (n = 201), blue-collar work (n = 148), nonprofit work (n = 141), and managerial work (n = 133). Our findings demonstrate that job characteristics are important drivers of work passion. However, our key discovery is that the motivational impact of the job characteristics is not universally applicable but rather depends on the specific occupational context and whether passion is harmonious or obsessive. We therefore conclude that when it comes to translating job characteristics into work passion, the one-size-fits-all approach is not appropriate.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22201;Out of the shadow? The effect of high-status employee departure on the performance of staying coworkers in financial brokerage firms. Because high-status employees make disproportional contributions to firms, prior literature suggests that their departure would undermine various organizational outcomes. Building on recent literature, however, we suspect that a high-status employee may have seized disproportional resources and credits from coworkers, thereby restricting them from performing, particularly when the work context is more independent and contested. As a result, the departure of a high-status employee may bring staying coworkers more resources and incentives to perform, causing their performance to improve. To test this possibility, we examine the effect of high-status analysts' departure on the individual performance of analysts who remain, using a sample of sell-side analysts in Chinese financial brokerage firms. Employing a before-and-after treatment research design, we find evidence that after the departure of a high-status analyst, the staying coworkers' individual performance is significantly improved. It is particularly so when they share greater industry overlap with the departing analyst. Our extensional analyses also investigate additional contingencies, which helps provide valuable hints about possible mechanisms.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22181;To stand out or fit in? How perceived overqualification motivates proactive and affiliative performance. Contributing to the literature on positive effects of overqualification, this research examines when and why perceived overqualification predicts affiliative and proactive performance at work. Integrating optimal distinctiveness theory with self-construal theory, we propose that depending on the nature of an employee's self-construal (i.e., independent, or interdependent), perceived overqualification will be associated with two opposing motivational processes-namely, differentiation and assimilation. We expect perceived overqualification to have a positive relationship with a motive for assimilation when an employee has a strong interdependent self-construal. Conversely, we expect perceived overqualification to have a positive relationship with a motive for differentiation when an employee has a strong independent self-construal. We further argue that assimilation-seeking and differentiation-seeking motives will be positively related to affiliative and proactive performance, respectively. We conducted two multi-waved and multisourced studies to test our hypotheses. In a pilot study (N = 249), we first tested our moderation hypothesis. In our main study (N = 496), we tested our overall moderated mediation model. Results from both studies reveal that perceived overqualification can trigger a need for differentiation or assimilation in employees depending on the nature of their self-construal. The differentiation-seeking motive was positively related to proactive performance, while the assimilation-seeking motive was positively related to affiliative performance. Our findings advance overqualification and motivation literatures and provide insights into talent acquisition and management.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22156;Communication quality and relational self-expansion: The path to leadership coaching effectiveness. Leadership coaching-a relational process by which a professional coach works with a leader to support their development-is a common component of learning and development portfolios in organizations. Despite broad agreement about the importance of the coaching relationship, relational processes remain undertheorized, failing to account for the growth and intertwining of coach-leader self-concepts as they engage in a generative and co-creative coaching process. To address these shortcomings, we reconceptualize the relational process within coaching as one of relational self-expansion and theorize that the communication channel and communication quality impact relational self-expansion which, in turn, influences coaching effectiveness. Our hypotheses are tested in a field experiment featuring random assignment to experimental conditions (communication channels) in which a coaching intervention was deployed in five organizations. Using structural equation modeling, we demonstrated that communication quality and relational self-expansion during the coaching process positively predicted coaching effectiveness. Contrary to expectations, communication quality did not differ by channel (phone, videoconference, face-to-face) nor did it predict relational self-expansion.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22063;Culture and performance appraisal in multinational enterprises: Implementing French headquarters' practices in Middle East and North Africa subsidiaries. Performance appraisal requires interactions between managers and employees and as such can be highly sensitive to differences in cultural values. This can be challenging when multinational enterprises (MNEs) are active across different institutional contexts, particularly when operating in the culturally complex Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. In this qualitative study, we apply institutional theory to explore how performance appraisal practices are implemented and internalized in MNE subsidiaries in the MENA region through manager-employee interactions. A total of 117 interviews were conducted with different headquarter and subsidiary stakeholders (managers and employees) of four French MNEs operating in Lebanon and Tunisia. The findings indicate that, during implementation, performance appraisal criteria, evaluation, and feedback were adapted based on socio-cultural values to achieve internalization. Such values include the emotional relationship between managers and employees, the fear of losing face, high power distance, the desire to avoid confrontation, and high-context communication. Insights for future research are presented regarding the viability of MNEs operating in the MENA region implementing corporate performance appraisal practices.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22254;Included Yet Socially Anxious: How Disability Severity and Nonacceptance Weaken the Effect of Perceived Climate for Inclusion on Social Anxiety. Understanding the workplace experiences of people with disabilities (PWD) is crucial for creating truly inclusive environments. We explore how perceived climate for inclusion affects social anxiety among employees with varying levels of disability severity. Adopting an interactionist perspective, we propose a mediated moderation model in which disability severity weakens the negative effect of perceived climate for inclusion on social anxiety, with this effect mediated by acceptance of disability. To test our hypotheses, we conducted two studies: one with a sample of Chinese employees and another with a culturally diverse sample. We found that the protective effect of perceived climate for inclusion on reducing social anxiety diminishes as disability severity increases, because individuals with more severe disabilities have lower levels of acceptance of disability. These findings underscore the complexities of fostering workplace inclusion and highlight the critical role of self-acceptance in shaping the effectiveness of inclusive initiatives. Our research contributes to the literature on disability, inclusion, and workplace diversity by revealing the nuanced dynamics that influence social anxiety among PWD in inclusive settings.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22244;Gender promotion gaps across business units in a multiunit organization: Supply- and demand-side drivers. Drawing on gender role and gender queuing theories, we employ a multi-stage process model to investigate demand- and supply-side drivers of gender promotion gaps and to explore variations in these gaps across different business units within an organization. Analyzing 9 years of personnel records from a multiunit European bank, we find that the gender promotion gap is influenced by both supply-side and demand-side factors. Specifically, women are less likely than men to express a motivation to change to a new job or move to a different unit within the bank. Those who do express such motivation are as likely as men to be reassigned to new roles, but their moves are less likely to constitute promotions than are men's moves. Furthermore, gender promotion gaps vary significantly within the organization itself. Business units with the most significant gaps are in regions that have fewer available organizational positions to move into, diminishing women's motivation to seek such moves, and have jobs with numerous incumbents, decreasing women's chances to get a new job or secure a promotion upon doing so. This study extends gender role theory by creating a unified theoretical model that incorporates both employee and employer gender role perceptions as drivers of promotions. It contributes to gender queuing theory by demonstrating the theory's relevance to promotion outcomes.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22229;Motivational strivings, human resource management practices, and job performance: An advancement of the theory of purposeful work behavior. Understanding how employees respond to HR systems is a critical question in the strategic HR literature and the need for more nuanced theoretical frameworks explaining who responds differentially to HR systems persists. Drawing on a contingency perspective and the theory of purposeful work behavior, we present a theoretical framework that suggests that employee motivational goal strivings interact with commensurate HR bundles (communion-enhancing HR bundles, status-enhancing HR bundles, and achievement-enhancing HR bundles) to predict employee job performance. Based on survey data collected from 362 employees in 84 service units, our findings reveal that the effects of communion and status strivings on job performance are more positive and stronger for employees in units with higher levels of communion-enhancing HR bundles and status-enhancing HR bundles, respectively. In contrast, the effect of achievement goal strivings on job performance is weaker in units with higher levels of achievement-enhancing HR bundles. These findings have significant implications for both theoretical and practical perspectives, shedding light on the role of employee motivations in shaping the effectiveness of HR bundles on employee performance.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22222;The effects of relational human resource management: A moderated mediation model of positive affective climate and collective occupational calling. Relationship-oriented human resource management (HRM) contributes to organizational functioning by promoting employee relationships, coordination, and cooperation. We propose unit-level positive affective climate as a motivational mechanism through which relationship-oriented HR systems can positively influence unit service quality and relationships with beneficiaries, and prevent individual emotional exhaustion. Moreover, we propose collective occupational calling serves as an alternative motivational source that can substitute for the positive effects of positive affective climate. In analyzing a sample composed of 742 nurses from 48 nursing units of two hospitals in China with data collection at three time points before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, our results supported the substituting effects of unit-level collective occupational calling on positive affective climate stemmed from relationship-oriented HR systems. Our study connects strategic HRM and motivation research by shedding light on an affective mechanism from relationship-oriented HR systems and the contingencies involving employees' various sources of motivation, such as occupational calling. We further discuss theoretical and practical implications of the research.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22166;Backlashes or boosts? The role of warmth and gender in relational uncertainty reductions. Both men and women who violate gender stereotypes incur backlashes, or penalties, for these transgressions. However, men who engage in warm, communal behaviors occasionally receive a boost (or benefit) for this female-stereotyped behavior. To understand how and why warmth and gender interact to predict backlashes or boosts, we integrate uncertainty reduction theory with the stereotype content model and examine warmth by gender interactions. In our first study (a field examination of job seekers), we find that men receive a boost in hireability (i.e., an increased likelihood of obtaining a job offer) for exhibiting gender incongruent (i.e., high) levels of warmth, but women do not receive a backlash in hireability for exhibiting gender incongruent (i.e., low) levels of warmth. In our second study (a laboratory experiment), we replicate and extend these findings by elucidating why they occur: warmth reduces relational uncertainty for male, but not female, applicants. In our third study (another laboratory experiment), we again replicate and extend our findings by identifying when these effects are stronger: in male-dominated roles. Our investigation suggests that the valence of the gender stereotype violation matters when it comes to hiring decisions. Indeed, we find that displaying warmth appears to promote, rather than impede, career outcomes for men.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This article explores the gaps in strategic human resource management (SHRM) research exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic in order to guide future SHRM research in the context of environmental crises. Using evidence from Danish companies and public organizations collected using a mixed-methods sequential design, we discuss whether existing SHRM frameworks can adequately frame and deliver the academic knowledge needed to address the novel challenges posed by the pandemic. We formulate guidelines for future research that will shape discussions of the role of SHRM in building organizational resilience in the face of environmental crises.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22084;The treatment of disabled individuals in small, medium-sized, and large firms. Integrating literature on small firm informality and organizational growth and development into Stone and Colella's model of the workplace treatment of disabled individuals, we assess prior claims that disability employment outcomes are better in large firms than in small and medium-sized firms. Drawing on the principle of equifinality, we propose disability employment outcomes (workforce disability prevalence and disability gaps in contentment and job satisfaction) will not vary by firm size, given both the formalized approach of large firms (disability equality practices, HR specialists, and union recognition), and the more informal approach of small firms (greater job autonomy, a stronger fairness culture, better work-life balance, and single-site operations with closer personal relationships) may have benefits for disabled people. Analyzing nationally representative matched employer-employee data, we show that, as anticipated, formalized approaches are more prevalent in large firms (and to an extent medium-sized firms) and informal approaches are more prevalent in small firms, and disability employment outcomes do not vary by firm size. However, this appears to reflect the ineffectiveness (rather than effectiveness) of characteristics and practices associated with both large firm formality and small firm informality, with both being weakly associated with better disability employment outcomes.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2024-0159;Human resource management practices in corporate restructuring: a review and agenda for future research. Purpose - Although corporate restructuring has the potential to provide performance benefits to firms, it can also bring upheaval and challenges to the restructuring firms' employees. Further, the frequency of corporate restructuring across the business landscape shows no signs of abating. The purpose of this review paper is to identify and synthesize what is known about the selection, implementation and outcomes of the human resource management (HRM) practices that firms deploy in the context of corporate restructuring, with the additional aim of distilling fertile research areas for scholars and best-practice guidance for practitioners. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is based upon a systematic review of 110 articles published in highly-ranked, peer-reviewed journals from 2003 to 2023. Findings - This review surfaces the predominant ability-, motivation- and opportunity-enhancing HRM practices employed by restructuring firms. It further elucidates the major themes and challenges associated with the use and outcomes of these practices across firms and restructuring settings. The analysis illuminates gaps and opportunities in the literature to suggest future directions for the study of HRM practices and corporate restructuring. Originality/value - This paper identifies, categorizes and integrates the extant literature on HRM practices and outcomes in corporate restructuring, which is a topic that is salient to both researchers and managers. Papers are classified using the Ability, Motivation and Opportunity framework. An inclusive definition of corporate restructuring, which includes organizational, portfolio, governance and financial restructuring, is applied across two decades of research to provide a comprehensive and holistic assessment.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2023-0129;Workplace violence in extreme settings: the case of aged care workers and the role of anti-violence HRM and trust of managers on intention to leave. PurposeAged-care work has become an extreme form of work. Anti-violence HRM, comprising practices to combat workplace violence, is important in an industry with widespread violence. In this paper, we employ social exchange theory to better understand the effect of anti-violence HRM and trust in the manager on perceived nurse and PCA cynicism working in Australian aged care facilities and their subsequent intention to leave.Design/methodology/approachThis study used a mixed method with two stages. Stage 1 comprised semi-structured interviews with 10 managers and 50 nurses and PCAs working in Australian aged care facilities. Stage 2 comprised a survey of nurses and PCAs with a total of 254 completed responses in Time 1 (first wave) and 225 completed responses in Time 2 (second wave).FindingsWe tested three hypotheses and reported that interestingly anti-violence HRM was positively associated with organisational cynicism. Organisational cynicism mediated the relationship between anti-violence HRM and intention to leave. Worker trust in the manager moderated the relationship between anti-violence HRM practices and organisational cynicism, such that high levels of trust in the manager increased the effect of anti-violence HRM practices to reduce organisational cynicism and subsequently reduce intention to leave.Originality/valueWe find evidence that in aged care, workers' trust in their managers is critical for effectual anti-violence HRM. We argue that implementation of HRM practices may be more complex in extreme work settings. It is crucial to study HRM in situ and understand the root of social exchange(s) as a foundation for HRM to influence employee attitudes and behaviour.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-11-2022-0803;Realigning human resource development in Saudi public universities: exploring equity and social justice theories. PurposeSaudi Arabia (SA) is amongst the few countries with a significant foreign workforce who are employed in the higher education sector. More specifically, 39% of SA's academic staff members are foreign nationals and 63% of that proportion occupy professorial positions. Drawing from a workforce localisation perspective, the study was framed as an exploration of equity and social justice amongst Saudi nationals and foreign nationals in a university work setting. The authors employ the lens of how human resource development (HRD) opportunities are administered.Design/methodology/approachFollowing the choice of an exploratory qualitative study, the authors employed a multi-case study approach where each of the six universities represented a unit of analysis.FindingsThe authors found that nationality differences influenced access to HRD opportunities. These differences are reinforced by practices associated with procedural processes, managerial discretion and selective restrictions in accessing HRD opportunities.Social implicationsThe findings have both practical and social implications, specifically for the SA government's strategic vision of developing local human capabilities.Originality/valueThe workforce localisation agenda within the higher education sector has both a compounding effect on local human capital and supports SA's 2030 Vision and human capital target. Nonetheless, perceived inequity and injustice in accessing HRD opportunities by foreign nationals potentially undermine morale, academic quality standards and research performance, which impacts the development of future human capital and the 'Saudization' goals.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2023-0424;Exploring local job seekers perception toward employment in the private and public sectors in Qatar: implications for workforce nationalization policies. Purpose - The influx of expatriates to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries has led to labor imbalance inducing these countries to initiate workforce nationalization policies. However, despite the policies' emphasis on increasing the presence of nationals in all sectors, employing nationals in the private sector is still a critical challenge for policymakers. This paper explores local job seekers' and employees' perceptions of employment choices in the private and public sectors.Design/methodology/approach - Adopting a qualitative approach, data were collected through in-depth interviews with 28 local job seekers, either not currently employed or employed but seeking another job.Findings - The data revealed a contextualized understanding of positive and negative connotations pertaining to employment in the private and public sectors in Qatar.Research limitations/implications - Understanding nationals' negative preconceived notions against working in the private sector and the perceived benefits of public sector employment lays the groundwork for developing measures to help policymakers to create labor market-oriented policies that stimulate mobility between the public and private sectors.Originality/value - This study contributes to the workforce nationalization literature in the GCC countries by examining local job seekers' perceptions associated with employment in the private sector and the public sector. A closer examination of why nationals are hesitant to enter the private sector can propel the pendulum towards higher success rates of workforce nationalization.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

PurposeNo systematic review has previously been dedicated to comprehensively investigate predictors of well-being and ill-being in working contexts. Empirical studies have vastly associated well-being as the result of autonomous motivation and basic psychological needs satisfaction, while frustration results in ill-being. The purpose of this study is to integrate the variables identified in empirical studies associated with the occurrence of the phenomena, individual/organizational features and consequences associated with workers' well-being/ill-being.Design/methodology/approachThis systematic review includes 44 empirical studies published up to February 2021. Findings are summarized based on quantitative analysis of the evidence.FindingsResults reinforce the role of self-determined motivation and needs satisfaction in promoting well-being, while amotivation and needs frustration led to ill-being. Besides, they indicate that ill-being can both lead to negative consequences and diminish positive work outcomes. Findings also revealed that: integrated motivation does not seem to be empirically distinct from intrinsic and identified motivation in promoting well-being;art;" and amotivation seems to have a detrimental effect in workers' psychological health.Practical implicationsResults provide practical information for HRM practitioners to design work environments and practices that promote employees' psychological health.Originality/valueAn unprecedented framework that aggregates empirical findings regarding the antecedents, predictors and consequences of ill-being/well-being in working contexts is presented."",art";;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2020-0358;Psychological capital and work-home enrichment: job crafting as a mediator. PurposeBased on the Job Demands-Resources theory, this study investigates whether psychological capital (PsyCap) is a precursor of the one-directional work-to-home enrichment (WHE) process through a parallel mediation mechanism enabled by promotion-focused job crafting components.Design/methodology/approachA cross-sectional study was conducted on 231 Romanian employees. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM).FindingsPsyCap (what I can do) is an antecedent of all three promotion-focused job crafting behaviors (what I actually do) and WHE. Two specific job crafting dimensions - increasing social job resources and increasing challenging job demands - fully mediate the link between PsyCap and WHE. Increasing structural job resources does not predict WHE.Originality/valueThis study identifies PsyCap as an antecedent of WHE. It also uncovers underlying behavioral mechanisms that enable the transfer of resources from the work role to individuals' home role by investigating job crafting components as distinct dimensions. As such, it gives practitioners a clearer understanding of which behaviors they should seek to cultivate for employees to potentiate their home role through aspects of their job.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2021-0772;Sustainable HRM and class-based inequality. Purpose This paper points out that common human resource manageement (HRM) research and practice have overlooked employee's class of origin. Workers' class of origin can be seen as the elephant in the room in current HRM, being that it significantly affects organizational decision-making with negative social (increased class-based inequality) and organizational (inefficient allocation of human re-sources) effects. Design/methodology/approach The paper summarizes the partial, fragmented and multi-disciplinary literature on HRM and employees' social class of origin. Findings The paper shows how recruiting, selection, training and development practices systematically reinforce class-based inequality by providing high-class employees with more resources and opportunities compared to low-class employees. Practical implications The paper provides sustainable HR practitioners, educators and researchers with recommendations on how to address employees' social class of origin, improving organizational competitive advantage and reducing class-based inequality at the societal level. Originality/value The paper focuses on a topic which, in diversity management, is an elephant in the room (i.e. workers social class of origin).;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2021-0396;Effects of trust in organizations and trait mindfulness on optimism and perceived stress of flight attendants during the COVID-19 pandemic. PurposeThis research adopts the conservation of resources (COR) theory to examine the effects of trust in organizations and trait mindfulness on optimism and perceived stress of flight attendants in Thailand during the COVID-19 pandemic.Design/methodology/approachOnline survey data were collected from 234 flight attendants who work for five low-cost airlines based in Thailand. The data were analyzed by using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM).FindingsThe results show that trust in an organization and trait mindfulness are negatively associated with the perceived stress of flight attendants. Their associations are also partially mediated by optimism. Moreover, the moderating effect analysis reveals that trait mindfulness intensifies the positive association between trust in organizations and optimism.Originality/valueThe evidence from this research broadens COR theory by showing that different aspects of resources can be combined to strengthen the ability of individuals to gain more resources to lessen stress.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-09-2020-0699;Overcoming organizational politics with tenacity and passion for work: benefits for helping behaviors. Purpose This study unpacks the relationship between employees' perceptions of organizational politics and their helping behavior, by explicating a mediating role of employees' affective commitment and moderating roles of their tenacity and passion for work. Design/methodology/approach Quantitative survey data were collected from 476 employees, through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Findings Beliefs that the organizational climate is predicated on self-serving behaviors diminish helping behaviors, and this effect arises because employees become less emotionally attached to their organization. This mediating role of affective commitment is less salient to the extent that employees persevere in the face of challenges and feel passionate about working hard. Practical implications For human resource managers, this study pinpoints a lack of positive organization-oriented energy as a key mechanism by which perceptions about a negative political climate steer employees away from assisting organizational colleagues on a voluntary basis. They can contain this mechanism by ensuring that employees are equipped with energy-boosting personal resources. Originality/value This study addresses employees' highly salient emotional reactions to organizational politics and pinpoints the critical function of affective commitment for explaining the escalation of perceived organizational politics into diminished helping behavior. It also identifies buffering effects linked to two pertinent personal resources.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2021-0098;Threat or opportunity: accelerated job demands during COVID-19 pandemic. Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of accelerated job demands on employee outcomes during the COVID-19 crisis. An integrated model was developed to explore the relationships between different types of job demands (learning, decision-making, work intensification), employee turnover intention (TI) and burnout (BU). Design/methodology/approach Data were obtained from professionals whose work conditions were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. An online survey was distributed anonymously. A total of 566 questionnaires were included in the analysis. Structural equation modeling was employed to analyze the data. Findings The findings revealed that employees' perception of job demands impacts the significance and direction of the relationships between different forms of job demands and employee outcomes. Furthermore, the findings confirm that mediating role of perceived organizational support alleviates the adverse effects of job demands on employee outcomes. Finally, the present study supported the moderation effect of positive affectivity between work intensification and employee BU. Practical implications This study provides employers with insights about supporting employees to cope with increased job demands in conditions where rapid changes are inevitable. Originality/value The unique context of research (COVID-19) enabled this study to account for the acceleration of job demands that employees experience in rapidly changing situations. This study employed an instrument that allowed for the assessment of acceleration in job demands. Furthermore, the granular approach of the measurement model extended the perspectives of job demands and work intensification.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-08-2020-0612;Returnee status, academic staff rewards and psychological contract fulfilment in China's higher education sector. Purpose China's universities have decoupled academic staff rewards and returnee status (scholars with a higher degree or substantial work experience gained outside China). This development possibly poses a threat to returnees' psychological contract fulfilment (PCF), i.e. the extent to which employees perceive their employer has fulfilled their promises or obligations regarding the employment relationship. Drawing on the efficiency-flexibility balance theory, the authors predict Chinese universities would institutionalise human resource management (HRM) practices intended to countervail the decoupling's potentially negative influence. Furthermore, the positive effect of returnee status on PCF would subsequently manifest as higher job satisfaction and lower turnover intention. Design/methodology/approach Utilising a mixed-method approach, the authors first undertook a large-scale multi-time field survey of Chinese business school academics from a group of non-elite universities located in Southern China. The authors then conducted a series of in-depth interviews with a subsample of the surveyed cohort, which was then analysed using multivariate regression analyses and machine-aided qualitative content analysis (i.e. NVivo 10). Findings The authors find that, despite the decoupling of returnee status and faculty rewards, returnee status is positively associated with PCF. This positive association further manifests as an indirect effect on job satisfaction and a negative indirect effect on turnover intention. The authors also determine that returnees experience higher PCF because universities have revised HRM practices to reward evidenced job activities. Returnees can gain a competitive advantage by using their skills gained overseas. Originality/value This study makes four original contributions. First, the authors investigate a neglected yet essential issue, namely, how returnee status relates to PCF in China's universities. Second, the authors enrich the theoretical understanding by introducing the efficiency-flexibility balance theory into the employee PCF literature. Third, the authors provide new insights on how China's universities maximise the effectiveness of academic returnees' talents and skills. Finally, by focusing on non-elite universities, the authors provide insights relevant to a broader faculty population than is available in the existing literature.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2020-0255;Organizational identification of knowledge workers in India: causes, consequences and the relevance of context. Purpose This research develops and tests a model for organizational identification (OID) in a sample of knowledge workers in India. It calls attention to the relational antecedents of OID that are often overlooked in existing literature. Strong theoretical arguments are also built for context-specific outcome behaviors such as intrinsic motivation (IM) and innovative work behavior (IWB) that are relevant to knowledge work. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 357 IT industry employees in India. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to test the hypotheses and the path model. Findings Strong support was found for relational antecedents of OID and the outcome variable IWB. The findings indicated that OID impacts IWB through the mediating mechanism of IM. Overall, the model demonstrated strong predictive power. Practical implications The findings suggest that social and relational variables could be strong managerial levers to increase the feeling of belongingness experienced by knowledge workers in India. In turn, OID can impact IWB, which is a significant outcome for knowledge work. Originality/value The study finds strong support for hypothesized relationships that have been unexplored or underexplored in mainstream OID literature. Relational antecedents were found to be strong predictors of OID in this sample. Also, the relationship between OID and IWB, an outcome behavior that is specifically relevant to knowledge-driven businesses, has not been explored earlier.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2020-0260;Career adaptability, job crafting and subjective career success: the moderating roles of lone wolf personality and positive perfectionism. Purpose Using career construction theory, the authors empirically examine the mechanism by which career adaptability promotes employee subjective career success (career satisfaction and career commitment) through job crafting. Design/methodology/approach A moderated mediation model is tested using survey data from 324 full-time business professionals in France. Hypotheses are tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings he authors found that job crafting mediated the relationship between career adaptability and subjective career success (career satisfaction and career commitment). The positive effect of career adaptability on job crafting was greater under higher levels of lone wolf personality and positive perfectionism, as was the indirect effect of career adaptability on subjective career success via job crafting. Research limitations/implications data are cross-sectional in nature. Robust theoretical contentions and affective means of identifying common method variance (CMV) are addressed and evaluated. Practical implications High levels of career adaptability may be a useful strategy for promoting employee job crafting and subjective career success. In addition, individuals with lone wolf personality and positive perfectionism should be given opportunities to craft their jobs in the workplace. Originality/value This research confirms a moderated mediation model positioning job crafting as a mediator of career adaptability's effects on employee subjective career success and lone wolf and positive perfectionism as moderators of such effects. This study suggests that job crafting and career-focused personality traits are important factors that influence the relationship between career adaptability and subjective career success.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-12-2019-0703;Managing voluntary collective turnover: the impact of a cynical workplace climate. Purpose Voluntary collective turnover can be costly for workplaces. The authors investigate the effectiveness of high-performance work system (HPWS) intensity as a tool to manage voluntary collective turnover. Further, the authors investigate a cynical workplace climate (CWC) as a boundary condition on the HPWS intensity-voluntary collective turnover relationship. Design/methodology/approach The unit of analysis is the workplace, with human resource (HR) managers providing data on HPWS practices in Time 1 (T1) and voluntary collective turnover two years later. Aggregated employee data were used to assess the cynical workplace climate. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses. Findings This study's results demonstrate a negative relationship between HPWS intensity and voluntary collective turnover when there is a low cynical workplace climate. The authors find that in a high cynical workplace climate, HPWS intensity is ineffective at managing voluntary collective turnover. Research limitations/implications This study's results show that HPWS intensity needs to be well received by the workforce to be effective in reducing voluntary collective turnover. Practical implications To increase the chances of HPWS intensity reducing voluntary collective turnover, workplaces need to assess the level of employee cynicism in their workplace climates. When the climate is assessed as low in cynicism, the workplace can then consider implementing an HPWS. Originality/value The authors explain why the HPWS intensity-voluntary collective turnover relationship varies across workplaces. As HR practices are subject to interpretation, workplaces need to look beyond the practices in their HPWS and focus on employee receptivity to HR practices.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2020-0361;Performance management systems promote job crafting: the role of employees' motivation. Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of performance management systems (PMSs) and their perceived accuracy on job crafting behaviors via motivation. Design/methodology/approach By adopting a research design based on three waves, a mediation model was tested using survey data from 12 municipalities in Italy. Findings Perceived PMS accuracy positively influences approach job crafting behaviors through intrinsic motivation and avoidance job crafting behaviors through extrinsic motivation. Practical implications Organizations interested in promoting job crafting should ensure that PMSs are designed and implemented in a way that increases perceived PMS accuracy among employees. Originality/value The results of this study enrich the literature on job crafting by underlining the role of PMSs as an antecedent of job crafting and by clarifying how different motivational processes may intervene in this relationship.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2019-0230;Homophily: functional bias to the talent identification process?. Purpose - This empirical study aims to analyse the talent spotters' perception of their tendency to be homophilic in the talent identification process and their stance on it. Besides, this article examines the type of homophily and the homophily attributes involved.Design/methodology/approach - Based on a qualitative design, 37 middle and senior line managers, working for two Argentine conglomerates in six Latin American countries, participated in the study. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews.Findings - Homophily was perceived by most of talent spotters, who judged it as natural, while it was not perceived by a small group of the interviewees. In addition, among those who recognized its presence, another group advocated the homophilic advantages, while a final one admitted the presence of homophily and its negative implications. In addition, a variety of homophily attributes were identified;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-12-2019-0664;Diverse effects of team diversity: a review and framework of surface and deep-level diversity. Purpose - While diversification within organisations is seen by many to be a strategic move, there is conflicting evidence about what makes diverse teams successful. The purpose of this paper is to highlight a range of complex, and in some cases contradictory, research contributions towards several key areas of diversity within teams, and to propose a framework for integrating existing approaches and clarifying inconsistencies in this domain.Design/methodology/approach - Aliterature review was conducted to explore several key areas of surface and deep-level diversity in teams, with the discussion included in this paper highlighting many of the inconsistencies and complexities associated with this research domain.Findings - This review highlights the need for future research to look at the effects of surface and deep-level diversity simultaneously, over time, across multiple levels and with a broad range of contextual moderators, to examine their impact on a range of outcomes.Originality/value - In order to account for the complexities within diversity research, the authors propose the use of the job demands-resources (JDR) model which suggests possible explanations for inconsistent findings and bridges the gap between commonly used theoretical perspectives.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22165;Gender-ethnicity intersectional variation in work-family dynamics: Family interference with work, guilt, and job satisfaction. Although guilt is often considered the most prevalent emotional outcome of work-family conflict (WFC), most work-family research focuses on family-related guilt stemming from work interference with family, rather than job-related guilt stemming from family interference with work (FIW). In addition, there is little understanding of how different employee social groups experience the implications of FIW in their daily lives. To address these research gaps, this study explores the relationship between daily FIW and job-related guilt, and its subsequent impact on job satisfaction. It also investigates variation in these relationships by (1) gender and (2) the intersection of gender and ethnicity. Bayesian multilevel structural equation modeling using data from 5-day diary surveys from 210 solicitors in Britain shows daily FIW is associated with higher job-related guilt and subsequently lower job satisfaction. The relationship is stronger for women than men in general, but is also stronger for South Asian women than white British women (and men), and for South Asian men than white British men. This suggests that studies focusing on single social group characteristics (e.g., gender) are likely to obscure intersectional effects that might produce significant within-group variation. The findings also highlight the importance of integrating workplace inequality arguments into theorization of WFC.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22118;Representative-negotiated i-deals for people with disabilities. Although substantial research has been devoted to describing the challenges people with disabilities face in the workplace, much less attention has been focused on the processes that can bring about change. This article explores a proactive process, representative-negotiated idiosyncratic work arrangements (i-deals), that can create the conditions for long-term employment for people with disabilities. Specifically, we explored the factors associated with the development and success of representative-negotiated i-deals for people with disabilities. Using focus groups and interviews with employers and job developers, we identified nine factors and two prevailing conditions that explain the contexts in which representative-negotiated i-deals will be successful. In doing so, we identified the negotiation stage during which these factors and prevailing conditions influence the i-deals negotiation process. Representative-negotiated i-deals offer insights into how employees with disabilities can find more meaningful work. Together, these findings underscore how the representative i-deals negotiation process is only viable if the facilitating factors are present and supported, while the absence of these factors can hinder and lead to failure.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22257;Work-Related Intimate Partner Violence (WIPV): A Systematic Review and Feminist Conceptual Analysis. Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a long-standing and egregious social issue that inherently impacts and is impacted by work and workplaces. Work-related intimate partner violence (WIPV) is a pattern of IPV that both directly and indirectly undermines victim-survivors' employment, work, and careers, yet scant attention has been paid in management studies to workplace responses and responsibilities regarding this form of violence. Hence, we conduct a systematic review and conceptual analysis of 111 WIPV-focused papers utilizing three well-established feminist lenses to ascertain and conceptualize what we know and do not know about the WIPV domain and, more importantly, to outline an agenda for what we should know from a gendered perspective about WIPV. We develop a gender-sensitive, multilevel framework with which we investigate and challenge the WIPV research agenda from individual, interactionist, and structural viewpoints, including the interaction between these perspectives. A key purpose of this paper is to extend debate about WIPV beyond the current focus of human resource management (HRM) research and practice on micro-level employment issues to include meso-level organizational and macro-level societal issues. A second and connected purpose is to draw attention to the need to address big societal challenges related to workplaces and to highlight the pivotal role of HRM in fostering ethical and socially sustainable workplaces. Thus, we advance the vital debate about WIPV, provide a template for how gender can be conceptualized in HRM and workplace research, and challenge the boundaries for organizational involvement in areas traditionally deemed as private or societal.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22250;Feel the Pressure? Normative Pressures as a Unifying Mechanism for Relational Antecedents of Employee Turnover. Relational perspectives on turnover antecedents have gained momentum in recent years, highlighting three distinct relational forces underlying employees' turnover decisions-notably, job embeddedness, social capital, and turnover contagion. However, these distinct perspectives are typically examined independent of one another, with little theoretical integration or holistic understanding of the shared mechanisms through which these relational antecedents operate on turnover intentions and behavior. We propose a conceptual model integrating the three types of relational antecedents (specifying their unique effects), while positing normative pressures from work and nonwork relationships as a fundamental consideration underlying quit decisions that translates their effects on leaving. Our model tests find support for this common mediator, even when controlling for traditional mediating mechanisms (i.e., job attitudes and perceived alternatives). Our tests also include important cultural considerations, allowing for comparisons between national cultures in our sample of nearly 700 surveyed employees and their subsequent quit intentions and behaviors, spanning the USA, Hong Kong, and China. Our tests revealed that on- and off-the-job embeddedness reduces quit propensity while prospective colleague turnover boosts that propensity. Path analyses further determined that normative pressures predict quit propensity (beyond attitudes and alternatives), and that such pressures mediate how job embeddedness and prospective coworker turnover influence quit propensity. We tease apart these effects across national cultures and discuss theoretical and practical implications of our findings.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22226;Saving face: Leveraging artificial intelligence-based negative feedback to enhance employee job performance. Negative performance feedback is vital for stimulating employees to enhance their performance despite resulting in stress and adverse work outcomes. Fortunately, artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled automated agents have gradually assumed certain functions led by human leaders, such as providing feedback. Drawing from regulatory focus theory, we propose that AI-based feedback systems can serve as a remediation tool, effectively mitigating employees' apprehensions about receiving negative feedback. In two studies, we found that for employees who fear losing face, AI-based negative feedback motivates promotion-focused cognition-motivation to learn-representing a learning mechanism to promote job performance and impedes their prevention-focused cognition-interpersonal rumination-reducing the depletion needed for job performance. These findings present novel perspectives on using AI in performance feedback.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22224;Managing upward and downward through informal networks in Jordan: The contested terrain of performance management. This study explores how local managers, in practicing Human Resource management (HRM), may pursue their own interests that are out of line with the agendas of headquarters in multinational companies (MNCs). It is widely acknowledged that informal networks have an impact on HRM practices in emerging markets. While these networks are often regarded as beneficial for organizations in compensating for institutional shortfalls, they may also lead to corruption, nepotism, or other ethical transgressions. Indigenous scholarship on informal networks in emerging markets has highlighted how their impact occurs through a dynamic process;art;" the latter includes not only more vulnerable local employees but also expatriates. This phenomenon becomes particularly evident during the performance appraisal process, which may serve as a basis for the differential treatment and rewards of employees. Consequently, this further dilutes the capacity of MNCs to implement-as adverse to espousing-centrally decided approaches to HRM."",art";;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22147;Best friend or broken tool? Exploring the co-existence of humans and artificial intelligence in the workplace ecosystem. Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an important topic in business literature and strategy talk. Yet, much of this literature is normative and conceptual in nature. How organizational members perceive AI and the job role changes that come with it is, so far, largely unknown territory for both HR scholars and practitioners. We sought to investigate the relationship between humans and AI and conducted an in-depth exploratory study into the co-existence of humans and two early-stage AI-solutions, one for low-status automation and another for high-status;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22129;Contextualizing social networks: The role of person-organization fit in the network-job performance relationship. While scholars have attended to the performance implications of employee embeddedness in social networks within the workplace, less research accounts for the interface of employee and organizational values in enabling employees to leverage these networks. Network perspectives on employee performance acknowledge that certain informal network positions create resources that are beneficial for performance while simultaneously creating demands that may diminish or erode these benefits. Leveraging a Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) perspective, we suggest that person-organization (PO) fit-the perceived congruence between individual and organizational values-will play a crucial role in shaping the performance effects of demands and resources inherently generated by workplace relationships. Results suggest that PO fit moderates relationships between network positions and individual job performance. Specifically, we find that having many friendships or being heavily sought out for advice enhances performance for those with higher levels of PO fit. Supplemental analyses highlight that incoming friendships or advice ties that are cross-functional are still beneficial for those among the highest in PO fit, but also that these same network positions can be detrimental for employees who are among the lowest in PO fit. These results contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the demands and resources generated by informal networks and how the translation of these features into performance is contingent upon the extent to which an employee identifies with organizational values.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22117;Riding the wave to recovery: Relational energy as an HR managerial resource for employees during crisis recovery. Human resource (HR) managers play a critical role in supporting workers during organizational crisis recovery, but this support is hampered when employee energy is drained during difficult times. We develop relational theory and practical suggestions to address how employees can generate energy from interpersonal interactions in a post-crisis context. Drawing from interviews, field observations, and archival data of interpersonal interactions in the surf and boardsport industry in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis, we investigated individual energetic contributions and the process which generated relational energy, defined as psychological resourcefulness generated from interpersonal interactions that enhances work capacity. Our analysis revealed that in the aftermath of a crisis, employees generated relational energy by engaging in processes of perspective taking and interpersonal adjustment while engaging in crisis-recovery work. This was particularly true when their personal contributions to the interactions were negative or neutral in valence and of low intensity. This is in contrast to assumptions in the literature and industry cultural norms, but was essential to fueling interdependent work efforts during crisis recovery. These findings extend and refine theory on energy at work to help inform HR practice by developing understanding of how the energy generated from other people can be an important resource to help sustain crisis recovery, and how HR managers can support these processes.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22109;Organizational social activities and knowledge management behaviors: An affective events perspective. Research indicates that relationship-oriented HR practices can increase organizational knowledge, yet we know little about the effects of relationship-oriented HR practices on employee knowledge management behaviors. Drawing from affective events theory, we examine the indirect effect of participation in one type of relationship-oriented HR practice (i.e., organizational social activities) on three knowledge management behaviors (i.e., knowledge sharing, knowledge hiding, and knowledge manipulating) via positive affect, as well as the conditional indirect effect of intrinsic motivation for organizational social activities on these relationships. Utilizing a time-separated field study (n = 163), our analysis reveals positive affect fully mediates the relationship between participation in organizational social activities and (a) knowledge sharing and (b) knowledge hiding, and partially mediates the relationship between participation in organizational social activities, and (c) knowledge manipulating. Most interestingly, we unexpectedly found a positive direct effect of participation in organizational social activities on knowledge manipulation, even though the indirect effect via positive affect was negative. The results also indicate that, for individuals with high intrinsic motivation for social activities, there is a significant indirect effect of participation in organizational social activities on all three knowledge management behaviors.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1002/hrm.22238;The impact of a compressed workweek on shareholder value: An event study analysis of Belgium's 4-day workweek legislation. While the compressed workweek (CWW) has gained traction in recent years, its impact on firms' financial performance is not well understood. This study addresses this gap in the literature by examining the effect of the CWW on shareholder value. Drawing on social exchange theory and its norm of reciprocity, we introduce a conceptual model on the main effect of the CWW on shareholder value, and the moderating roles of the anticipated type and degree of employee reciprocation. To test the model's predictions, we exploit the announcement of Belgium's mandatory adoption of a CWW in February 2022 as the setting for a policy event study analysis. We find positive average stock price reactions of Belgian listed firms to the CWW's announcement, consistent with investors expecting the CWW to result in favorable employee reciprocation. Stock price reactions are more positive for firms with a lower ex ante employee productivity, suggesting employees are predicted to reciprocate with higher efforts. Stock price reactions are also more positive for firms with a higher reliance on knowledge workers, consistent with these employees deriving a greater utility from flexible working arrangements. Robustness tests, including a placebo analysis and an event study of international firms with Belgian subsidiaries, corroborate our results. Our study offers several theoretical contributions and has practical implications for HR managers and policymakers.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22220;Women's representation in managerial hierarchies: An examination of trickle-down and pipeline effects. The trickle-down effect has been proposed as one means to address women's continued underrepresentation in leadership positions globally. While earlier research supported the trickle-down effect's prediction that increasing women's representation at higher managerial levels will positively impact women's careers at lower managerial levels, recent studies provide inconsistent evidence, leading to claims that it may be spurious. Due to data limitation, most prior trickle-down research has explored just two managerial levels-board and executives-making it difficult to separate a trickle-down effect from external pressures (e.g., shareholders, law) or internal factors (e.g., organizational culture) that may cause it. Furthermore, prior research does not adequately account for women's representation in managerial pipelines, a crucial source of potential managerial talent. To address these concerns, we analyze Australian workplace panel data (2014-2020) that allow for a more robust test of the trickle-down effect than previously examined. Our results support the trickle-down effect across multiple managerial levels below the board level, independent of managerial pipeline effects. The trickle-down and pipeline effects were only observed for positions immediately above and below each managerial level. This highlights the proximity of positions within management hierarchies where the in-group preference and women's direct advocacy for other women are most likely to occur. Our study suggests that simply appointing more women to top positions, such as boards, while beneficial, is not enough to address gender inequality in management meaningfully. We recommend that rather than focusing on gender representation at the top, organizations should set gender diversity goals and monitor progress at all managerial levels. We conclude with implications for theory, practice, and future research.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22215;What are interviews for? A qualitative study of employment interview goals and design. The employment interview is among the most versatile of staffing tools. Yet, the interview is rarely studied as a multipurpose tool. If the interview is used to serve multiple goals, then the interview can be effective (i.e., valid), and effectively designed, in multiple ways. The current study uses qualitative methodology to develop an inductive theory of interview goals and design based on conversational interviews with 29 experienced professional interviewers. Transcript data were analyzed with template analysis grounded in a postpositive epistemology and objectivist ontology. Results suggested that the interview is primarily used to serve three broad goals: performing a targeted assessment, making a positive impression, and informing the applicant. Interviewers reported a variety of strategies for adapting the interview to achieve and balance these goals. In short, findings suggest that the interview is used in multiple ways that have received very little research attention. These findings imply that the concept of interview validity should be expanded to include multiple interviewing goals, and that interview design should be understood as a complex function of these goals. Further implications for the research, theory, and practice of employment interviews are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22183;Contingencies in the effects of job-based pay dispersion on employee attitudes. When does pay dispersion elicit positive or negative employee attitudes? A review of the pay dispersion literature indicates a controversy around this vital question and suggests that numerous contingency factors moderate the effects of pay dispersion. In an empirical study of four Finnish companies consisting of 141 work units, we examine contingencies in attitudinal reactions to job-based pay dispersion among blue-collar workers. Based on archival pay data matched with employee survey responses (n = 536), we find that perceptions of pay basis legitimacy, task interdependence, and an individual's pay standing within the work unit explain the strength and direction of the relation between job-based pay dispersion and employee attitudes (i.e., work engagement and organizational commitment). Our findings have implications for the design of pay systems and contribute to a better appreciation of the complexities underlying employee attitudinal responses to pay dispersion.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22145;Does human resource system strength help employees act proactively? The roles of crisis strength and work engagement. Many empirical studies have elucidated the antecedents and psychological mechanisms of employees' proactive behaviors. However, there is limited knowledge about how a human resource (HR) system helps employees proactively adjust to their changing work environment. Drawing on social exchange theory and event system theory, we developed a theoretical model to examine whether, how, and when perceptions of the HR system strength impact employee proactive behavior during crises. Results from a three-wave time-lagged survey of 305 employees in 65 teams in eight Chinese companies indicate that HR system strength creates a strong situation by alleviating employees' uncertainty about how to behave during crises, which stimulates employees' work engagement and subsequent proactive behaviors. Moreover, employees' perceptions of HR system strength are more likely to influence work engagement when employees perceive the COVID-19 crisis as more severe. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the findings and outline important future research directions.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22142;High performance work systems and perceived organizational support: The contribution of human resource department's organizational embodiment. Integrating the literatures on strategic human resource management and organizational support theory, we examine the cross-level relationship between high performance work systems (HPWS) at the team-level and individual perceptions of organizational support (i.e., POS). In addition, we introduce a critical boundary condition, the HR department's organizational embodiment (HROE), which involves the extent to which employees identify the HR department with the organization. We propose that the cross-level HPWS-POS relationship is moderated by HROE, such that the linkage between HPWS and POS is stronger when HROE is high. With a sample of 103 teams and 399 employees in South Korea, we find that HPWS utilization increases POS and that this relationship is stronger when HROE is high. We also find that HR department status and the favorable attitude of the HR head are antecedents to HROE. These findings suggest that HROE is a critical boundary condition for the relationship between HPWS and POS with subsequent effects on organizational commitment and job satisfaction.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22107;Strategic human resource management in the era of environmental disruptions. This article-which serves as an introduction to the special issue of the role of (strategic) human resource management (HRM) in the era of environmental disruptions-summarizes previous research, introduces articles related to this special issue, and provides suggestions for future research in the area. This special issue intends to advance HRM research by putting it in the context of disruptive environments, aiming to deepen our theoretical and empirical knowledge about the role of HRM in these disruptive environments, and provide insights to managers and policymakers who must deal with current as well as future disruptions in extra-organizational environments. The different sections of this introductory paper are structured from the perspective of an individual (How can HRM help individual employees cope with environmental disruptions?), an organization (How can HRM help organizations be more resilient against environmental disruptions?), and a community/societal perspective (How can HRM help the community being affected by environmental disruptions?). We conclude by proposing several research ideas and practical implications for human resource professionals that would enable them to deal with individual employees, their organization, and the community in times of environmental disruptions.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22075;Does pay for individual performance truly undermine employee creativity? The different moderating roles of vertical and horizontal collectivist orientations. The extant literature has generated inconclusive findings concerning the effect of pay for individual performance (PFIP) on creativity. Supplementing self-determination theory with compensation-activation theory, we theorized and tested the moderating roles of individual cultural values of vertical and horizontal collectivist orientations on the relationship between PFIP and employee creativity as mediated by intrinsic motivation. The empirical results of two field studies provided convergent support for the intrinsic motivation mechanism underlying the positive relationship between PFIP and employee creativity among individuals with high vertical (but not horizontal) collectivist orientations. These findings highlight the importance of considering individual differences in cultural values in understanding how extrinsic rewards affect creativity.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-09-2021-0647;Team cognitive diversity and individual creativity: the roles of team intellectual capital and inclusive climate. PurposeThe function of cognitive diversity has not yet been studied to a sufficient degree. To address this gap, the current study aims to answer the questions of how and when team cognitive diversity fosters individual creativity by integrating the intellectual capital view and the inclusion literature.Design/methodology/approachWith a paired and time-lagged sample consisting of 368 members and 46 leaders from Chinese high-tech organizations, a multilevel moderated mediation model was developed to test the hypothesized relationships using structural equation modeling.FindingsTeam cognitive diversity is positively related to individual creativity via team intellectual capital, but this positive indirect effect is obtained only when the inclusive team climate is high.Research limitations/implicationsTeam intellectual capital serves as an alternative mechanism for translating team cognitive diversity into favorable outcomes, and an inclusive team climate plays a pivotal role in harvesting the benefits of team cognitive diversity. Future research could extend our study by adopting a multiwave longitudinal or experimental design, examining the possibility of curvilinearity, considering the changes in patterns over time, and conducting cross-cultural studies.Practical implicationsManagers should take the initiative to assemble a team featuring cognitive diversity when facing creative tasks, and should proactively cultivate an inclusive culture when leading such a team.Originality/valueThis study is among the first to consider the mediating role of team intellectual capital in the cross-level effect of team cognitive diversity on individual creativity and to examine the boundary role of an inclusive team climate with respect to this indirect effect.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2023-0315;Daily leader humor and healthcare workers' next-day helping behaviors: the roles of positive affect and difficulty in maintaining display rules. PurposeThe main purpose of our study is to investigate the impact of daily leader humor behaviors on healthcare workers' daily psychological state and behavioral outcomes.Design/methodology/approachBased on the conservation of resources (COR) theory, this study proposes that daily leader humor behaviors are positively related to healthcare workers' daily positive affect, which in turn affects their next-day helping behaviors towards patients. These predictions hinge on healthcare workers' difficulty in maintaining display rules. We conducted a lagged experience sampling methodology (ESM) survey of 621 complete daily observations from 93 healthcare workers who work in direct contact with patients at a large public hospital in China across consecutive 10 working days.FindingsResults of multilevel path analysis demonstrate that daily leader humor behaviors are positively related to healthcare workers' same-day positive affect, and this positive affect enhances their next-day helping behaviors towards patients. Furthermore, healthcare workers' higher difficulty in maintaining display rules attenuates the benefits of daily leader humor behaviors.Originality/valueBuilding on the COR theory and adopting a diary research design, this study shows daily fluctuations in leader humor behaviors and proposes a mechanism through which daily leader humor behaviors indirectly affect healthcare workers' next-day helping behaviors. Thus, our study disclosed possible means for healthcare organizations to improve service quality.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-03-2024-0284;Learning and development in highly dynamic VUCA contexts: a new framework for the L&D function. Purpose - This article introduces the special issue of Learning and Development in Highly-Dynamic VUCA Contexts. The issue reviews the concept of VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity), highlights its implications for the learning and development function and argues that learning and development play a critical role in helping organisations, people and the societal context in which they operate to work within and navigate VUCA contexts. Design/methodology/approach - The contributions to this special issue propose a novel learning and development framework that will inform L&D as the provision of training, learning and development activities in organisations within highly dynamic VUCA contexts and ensuring a strong external focus including organisational, people, community, economic and societal sustainability. Findings - We, the authors, propose seven features of a strategic sustainability L&D function and L&D professional role that are a fit with highly dynamic VUCA contexts. Practical implications - The proposed framework has important implications for the way in which L&D is structured, its key priorities and plans and the competencies of L&D professionals to add value to all stakeholders. We also emphasise that the work on the L&D function in highly dynamic VUCA contexts needs to be broader and move beyond a performance orientation. Originality/value - The proposed strategic sustainability role for the L&D function expands theoretically our understanding of how L&D can have impacts at the nexus of the organisation and highly dynamic VUCA contexts, in addition to broadening the constellation of stakeholders that it potentially enhances.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-09-2020-0716;The nexus between epistemic curiosity and innovative work behavior: role of leader-member exchange and work engagement. PurposeDrawing upon curiosity drive theory, we examine the effects of epistemic curiosity (EC) on employees' innovative work behavior. Additionally, we explore the potential mediating role of work engagement (WE) and the moderating effects of leader-member exchange (LMX).Design/methodology/approachThe data were collected from 406 employees employed in public service organizations within the United Arab Emirates. Structural equation modeling was employed as the analytical approach to test the hypotheses.FindingsThe findings of this study indicate that EC is positively related to innovative work behavior. Further, WE mediates the relationship between EC and creative work behavior. Moreover, LMX moderates the indirect effect of WE on the link between EC (interest and deprivation types) and innovative work behavior. The mediating association is stronger when the leader and member's exchange is high.Practical implicationsThis study will assist practitioners of service organizations in focusing their attention on EC to enhance employees' innovative work behavior and achieve optimal performance. Our research extends work on interest and innovative work behavior in an emerging economic context.Originality/valueOur study suggests that policymakers should embrace the philosophy of curiosity to nurture innovative behavior in the workplace.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2023-0886;Measuring learning agility: a review and critique of learning agility measures. PurposeThe purpose of this review is to evaluate existing learning agility measures and offer recommendations for their use in organizational and scholarly contexts.Design/methodology/approachThis is a general review paper assessing the psychometric qualities of prevalent learning agility measures. Measures were selected based on their predominance and use in the learning agility literature and organizational settings.FindingsLearning agility measurement is an area requiring further research. Multiple conceptualizations of learning agility exist, making the true structure of learning agility unclear. The learning agility measures in the academic literature deviate from learning agility's traditional conceptualization and require further validation and convergent validity studies. Commercial measures of learning agility exist, but their development procedures are not subjected to peer review and are not widely used in academic research, given the cost associated with their use.Practical implicationsLearning agility is prevalently used in organizational settings and is receiving increased scholarly attention. Various conceptualizations and measurement tools exist, and it is unclear how these theories and measures relate and differ. This paper contributes to practice by providing practical guidelines and limitations for measuring learning agility.Originality/valueLearning agility was initially conceived as a multidimensional construct comprising people agility, results agility, change agility and mental agility. As the construct has evolved, the dimension structure of the measure has evolved as well. This study addresses a gap in our current understanding of how to conceptualize and measure learning agility.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2019-0193;Career identity and organizational identification among professionals with on-demand work. Purpose Drawing upon the social identity theory, the authors argue that professionals' career identities have a positive indirect effect on identification with on-demand organizations through career networking behavior. In addition, the strength of these beneficial effects was also bound by extraversion and collectivism. Design/methodology/approach The hypothesized moderated mediation model was tested by multisource and time-lagged data about 242 Chinese accountants engaging in on-demand work. Findings The results demonstrated that professionals with a career identity tend to engage in career networking behaviors and identify themselves with a client company. In addition, extraverted professionals were more likely to engage in career networking behaviors, and collectivist professionals were more likely to identify with their on-demand organizations. Practical implications This research provides important guidelines on how managers in on-demand organizations leverage gig workers' career identities to establish deep relationships with them. Originality/value The authors expanded the traditional framework of identification in the setting of nontraditional work arrangements by establishing a link between career identity and organizational identification for on-demand professionals.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-09-2021-0650;Decent work among rural-urban migrant workers in China: evidence and challenges. Purpose This study aims to examine how Chinese rural-urban migrant workers' socio-economic status was associated with their decent work. Design/methodology/approach Grounded in the psychology of working theory (PWT), this study tested the path from rural-urban migrant workers' socio-economic status to decent work via work volition, with this path moderated by environmental uncertainty and trade union support. 470 rural-urban migrant workers from four manufacturing enterprises were investigated. Findings Results indicated that rural-urban migrant workers' socio-economic status was positively associated with rural-urban migrant workers' decent work through work volition. In addition, environmental uncertainty weakened the impact of socio-economic status on work volition while trade union support strengthened the relationship between socio-economic status and work volition. Originality/value The study contributes to the growing research on the PWT by testing its utility among rural-urban migrant workers in the Chinese context. The study also identifies the crucial effects of environmental uncertainty and trade union support, which are distinctive characters of contemporary China, in the formation process of rural-urban migrant workers' decent work. A detailed explanation of the results and implications is discussed in the end.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2020-0791;Human capital disclosure and the contingency view. Purpose Building on an integration of strategic human resource capital management and human capital disclosure literature streams, this paper explores the associations between human resource performance and human resource disclosure in the financial services sector. Design/methodology/approach Using content analysis and panel regression methods, the paper examines the extent, nature, and information content of human capital disclosures in the financial services sectors in North America during the global financial crisis period. Findings Labor costs and marginal labor productivity are significantly associated with human resource disclosure and the latter is significantly related to both financial (explicit) and non-financial (implicit or relational) components of the employment relationship. Results show inverted effects between the US and Canadian samples. The findings support a contingency view or best-fit approach to human resource capital management. Practical implications Differences in labor market structures and human capital attributes could have significant impacts on human capital disclosure strategies. More transparent and detailed disclosures regarding human resource capital management may provide useful and relevant information for investors and stakeholders in general. Originality/value The study provides insights into how labor market structures and human capital attributes jointly affect the extent and nature of corporate disclosures with regards to rents distribution and relational governance between employers and employees.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1108/PR-02-2021-0097;Authoritarian and benevolent leadership: the role of follower homophily, power distance orientation and employability. Purpose Drawing on follower-centric leadership theory, the study examines the role of perceived homophily between the leader and the follower, follower's individual-level power distance orientation (PDO) and follower's perceived employability in moderating the effects of authoritarian and benevolent paternalistic leadership (BPL) on followers' turnover intentions. Design/methodology/approach The study analyzes a sample of 403 white-collar Russian employees. Findings Whereas both leadership styles generally decrease followers' turnover intentions, they operate differently. Authoritarian leadership (AL) is more effective among followers with higher follower-leader homophily and PDO, whereas BPL is effective only among followers with low perceived homophily and PDO, and more effective among followers with higher perceived employability. Originality/value The study extends research on non-participative styles of leadership, their effects and boundary conditions.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-07-2020-0540;Managers' responses to the initial stages of the Covid-19 pandemic: an executive coaching perspective. Purpose This research investigates how the Covid-19 pandemic initially affected organisational managers, as seen from their executive coaches' perspective by asking: (1) What challenges did managers experience during the initial stages of the Covid-19 pandemic? and (2) How did coaching foster crisis management skills during this time? Executive coaches are in a unique, confidential and professionally intimate position to observe their clients' thoughts, emotions and behaviours. Design/methodology/approach Using an interpretivist approach, interviews conducted with 26 executive coaches from the USA, UK, Australia and South Africa during the initial stages of the pandemic (first three weeks of April 2020) were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings Coaches observed how the Covid-19 pandemic caused managers to experience a tension between managing their staff, their own bosses and themselves. Ranging from logistical challenges to personal fear, uncertainty and loss of identity, managers confided in and relied on their coaches to help them to reflect, provide support, but also challenge them to take a forward-looking stance. Findings were interpreted through the lenses of crisis management and coaching efficacy theory. Crisis management theory is extended by suggesting that greater priority must be given to managers' personal well-being and by adding coaching as a new intervention to develop crisis management skills. Coaching theory is extended by showing that executive coaching can foster certain crisis management skills and that the benefits of coaching in non-crisis times are also relevant during a crisis. Practical implications Managers, their leaders, executive coaches and purchasers of coaching services, such as human resource practitioners, should take note of the challenges managers face during crises. They should consider executive coaching as a support intervention to foster requisite crisis management skills. Originality/value The findings provide novel, empirical evidence suggesting that executive coaching could foster crisis management skills. The unique Covid-19 context provides rare insights into managerial thinking, emotions and behaviour during extreme crisis situations, contributing to the design of appropriate support interventions.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-08-2018-0314;Trendsetters of HRM: a systematic review of how professional service firms manage people. Purpose - Human resource management in professional service firms (PSF) is one of the most important instruments for promoting sustainable competitive advantage. Despite the major growth of scholars' interest in human resource management (HRM) issues in PSF, the body of knowledge in this field remains highly fragmented and diversified. The purpose of this paper is to systematize key evidence on the use of HRM practices in PSF.Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on a systematic literature review of 90 peer-reviewed journal papers.Findings - The review revealed typical ability-, motivation- and opportunity-enhancing practices used by PSF and outlined how these HRM practices may differ among various PSF.Originality/value - The paper provides scholars with an updated and comprehensive research landscape and development process in this important field, thereby contributing to greater research interest and enthusiasm for future research.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2024-0045;Impact of Islamic work ethic on employee ethical behavior: the serial mediation of moral identity and felt obligation. PurposeDrawing on conservation of resources, social cognitive and self-verification theories, the current study endeavors to extend our comprehension of the mechanisms linking Islamic work ethics (IWE) to employee ethical behavior. More specifically, the current study investigates the potential impact of IWE on employees' ethical behavior through the serial mediating roles of moral identity and felt obligation.Design/methodology/approachBy utilizing two-wave data collected from 513 employee-co-worker dyads in the education sector in Turkey, we employed AMOS to conduct a confirmatory analysis and the PROCESS macro for SPSS to test the hypothesized relationships.FindingsThe results provide evidence for our hypothesized model. Our results indicate that employees with higher levels of IWE are more likely to exhibit higher levels of ethical behavior. Our results also reveal that IWE has a significant and positive impact on employees' moral identity and sense of obligation, which in turn enhances their ethical behavior.Originality/valueBy integrating multiple theories, the current research addresses a dearth in the literature and provides a nomological network from Islamic work ethics to ethical employee behavior through the serial mediating role of moral identity and felt obligation. This study adds value to the literature on human resource management and work ethics by examining how IWE affects the attitudes and behaviors of employees in both the public and private sectors. Accordingly, organizations can strengthen their workforce's moral identities and instill a sense of obligation to behave morally by incorporating workplace ethics into HRM processes.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2023-0922;The same only different: precarious workers' perceptions of their treatment in COVID-19 times. PurposeOur core aim was to explore the perceptions of precarious workers on the ways in which the pandemic impacted their relationships with their employing organizations and to explore the ways in which they viewed the pandemic as (re)shaping the dynamics of precarious work and the extent to which they saw the pandemic as contributing to substantive improvement in their working lives or whether the pandemic is exacerbating their marginalisation.Design/methodology/approachWe adopted an approach akin to grounded theory in an exploratory research design and utilized in-depth, semi-structured interviews as the most apposite method of data collection. Our research design centred on a two-phase data collection approach, which were intended to gather data at two points. First, during the most difficult part of the pandemic, which we describe as the Lockdown phase and second, during the period wherein the pandemic rules were eased but elements of the risks remained;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-11-2022-0784;Employee recognition giving in crisis: a study of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. PurposeEmployee recognition systems are ubiquitous in organizations (WorldatWork, 2019) and have positive effects on work outcomes (e.g. Stajkovic and Luthans, 2001). However, psychologically meaningful recognition relies on the recognition giver being motivated to observe and recognize coworkers. Crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic may impact recognition giving in varying ways, yet little research considers this possibility.Design/methodology/approachThis longitudinal field study examined the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on recognition and acknowledgment giving among frontline and nonfrontline healthcare workers at daily and aggregated levels. We tested the relationships between publicly available daily indicators of COVID-19 and objectively measured daily recognition and acknowledgment giving within a web-based platform.FindingsWe found that the amount of daily recognition giving was no different during the crisis compared to the year before, but fewer employees gave recognition, and significantly more recognition was given on days when COVID-19 indicators were relatively high. In contrast, the amount of acknowledgment giving was significantly lower in frontline staff and significantly higher in nonfrontline staff during the pandemic than before, but on a daily-level, acknowledgment was unrelated to COVID-19 indicators.Practical implicationsOur results suggest that organizational crises may at once inhibit and stimulate employee recognition and acknowledgment.Originality/valueOur research is the first to empirically demonstrate that situational factors associated with a crisis can impact recognition giving behavior, and they do so in ways consistent with ostensibly contradictory theories.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2022-0093;How and when inclusive leadership enhances team proactivity: the roles of collective thriving and team power distance. PurposeThe present study was conducted to investigate the relationship between team-level inclusive leadership perceptions, team thriving, and team proactivity as well as the moderating effect of team power distance on these relationships.Design/methodology/approachA two-wave survey study of 365 manufacturing employees comprising 85 teams in an organization in Eastern China was used to test the hypotheses.FindingsThe findings indicate that inclusive leadership stimulates collective thriving, which then promotes team proactivity. In addition, team power distance negatively moderates the relationship between inclusive leadership and collective thriving, as well as the indirect effect of inclusive leadership on team proactivity via collective thriving.Originality/valueThis study is one of the first to investigate the effects of inclusive leadership at the team level, and answers recent calls to investigate the mechanisms linking leadership-related constructs to team-level proactivity. The authors also identify an important boundary condition to the effects of inclusive leadership in team power distance.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2022-0693;Technology infiltration: permeable boundaries and work-life spillover experiences among academics in the United Kingdom during the COVID-19 pandemic. PurposeThis study explored the challenges academics faced with work structures during the COVID-19 pandemic and their implications for their work-life balance (WLB).Design/methodology/approachRelying on the interpretative paradigm and the qualitative research method, the dataset consists of semi-structured interviews with 43 academics in the United Kingdom.FindingsThis study's findings indicate that academics in the UK experience issues around increased boundary permeability between work and nonwork domains and role overlap, which engender the transfer of negative rather than positive spillover experiences and exacerbate negative consequences to the well-being of academics. ICTs also reinforced gendered work-family boundaries and generated more negative work-life/family spillover for women than for men.Practical implicationsHigher Education Institutions (HEIs) need to address ICT-related health issues through better work designs and HR initiatives that respond to the health requirements of academics. Policymakers should be futuristic and ensure comprehensive work-life policies for academics, which are necessary for humanising overall organisational well-being.Originality/valueAlthough COVID-19 challenges are common to all workers, the experiences and effects on specific workers (in this case, UK academics) within specific national jurisdictions play out differentially, and they are often experienced with different levels of depth and intensity.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2022-0453;The yin and yang of employee voice: an exploratory study. PurposeThis study examines the yin (promotive) and yang (prohibitive) of employee voice based on employee preference for voice channel attributes. Employee inputs may be disregarded, requiring employees to maneuver for unheeded voice and adopt alternate voice tactics. The authors emphasize the ubiquity of lurking employee silence and its affective effects on subsequent cycles of voice or silence.Design/methodology/approachQualitative design involving semi-structured interviews of employees from service sector firms in India assisted the inquiry.FindingsEmployees prefer voice channel attributes that ensure visibility and data substance for promotive voice and anonymity and confidentiality for prohibitive voice. Voice target switching and message reframing were common employee strategies. Silence on both sharing views/opinions (promotive) and voicing issues/concerns (prohibitive) weakens employee future voice incidents, besides suppressing the affect. Post-silence cognitive reappraisal increases voice incidences.Research limitations/implicationsFindings may have limited generalizability given the qualitative design of the study. Moving beyond extant episodic voice research, the authors demonstrate the recurrent nature of employee voice and silence. The study broadens perspectives on how varied voice types necessitate nuanced voice channel attributes.Originality/valuePresent work brings together organizational behavior (OB) perspective on discretionary voice through human resource (HR)-based channels, helping bridge the gap between previously disparate stands.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2022-0030;Imposter phenomenon and employee mental health: what role do organizations play?. PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to explore impostor syndrome or impostor phenomenon (IP), which is defined as high-achieving individuals' failure to internalize accomplishments. Despite the wide study of IP, the role of the context beyond the individual is largely ignored, although recently, calls have been made for such scrutiny. In this study perceived organizational support (POS) is included as a contextual factor.Design/methodology/approachUsing a large and representative sample (n = 1,042) of New Zealand employees, the study seeks to investigate IP using the standard Clance IP scale test, and the frequency of IP is calculated. Next, it assesses the links between IP and mental health, specifically job anxiety and job depression, are explored. POS is included as a moderator.FindingsOverall, the study finds solid evidence of the psychometric properties of the scale, with the following frequencies across categories: few IP issues (14.0%), moderate IP issues (37.3%), frequent IP issues (39.7%) and intense IP issues (8.9%). Regression analysis shows that IP is positively related to job anxiety and job depression. The interactions between POS and IP support the hypothesized buffering effect. Additional tests suggest that IP is a widespread workplace phenomenon irrespective of individual or organization demographics.Research limitations/implicationsThe findings of this study highlight the common nature of IP in the workplace and its role in mental health. However, POS clearly can play a key role in its management in the workplace.Originality/valueThe IP literature has a limited focus on workplaces, and mental health, including POS as a moderator, and provides additional value.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2020-0385;Exploring the consequences of mindfulness at work: the impact of mindful organizing on employee attitudes and behavior toward work and organization. Purpose Drawing on the social exchange theory, the authors extend the high-reliability literature by examining employees' subjective experience of working in contexts engaging in mindful organizing (MO). Ultimately, they ask the question about how MO affects employees' attitudes and behavior toward work and organization, such us organizational commitment (OC), motivation to work and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), in ordinary business settings. The purpose of this paper is to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach The authors surveyed 307 employees from various industries, using paper-and-pencil questionnaires. A series of hierarchical regression analyses and structural equation modeling were performed to test our hypotheses. Findings The authors found that MO is positively related to employees' affective and normative commitment to an organization, and that affective commitment is positively related to motivation to work and OCB. The study also reveals that the affective commitment has a partially mediating role in the MO - motivation and MO - OCB relations. Although several researchers argue that the effectiveness of MO may be higher in an uncertain environment, the authors' study indicates that the environment does not moderate the relationship between MO and OC. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is one of the first attempts to explore the effects of MO in a traditional (i.e. nonhigh reliability) business context. Furthermore, their findings prove that MO not only leads to higher reliability and greater safety, as previous studies show, but it also positively affects performance-related attitudes and behavior.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-11-2020-0814;Exploring job resources as predictors of employees' effective coping with job stress. Purpose The purpose of this paper is to shed more light on the relative impact of the various workplace resources on employees' effective coping with job stress symptoms, taking into account synergistic and antagonistic effects. The authors used job demands-resources (JD-R) theory as an overarching theoretical framework to test the hypotheses. Design/methodology/approach The authors used a factorial survey experiment and a within-person design. Data were obtained from a random sample of 97 Greek employees working in public and private organizations. Multilevel modeling regression techniques were used for data analyses. The authors examined the relative effect of various job resources at different levels on employees' ratings of effective coping with job stress symptoms. In parallel, the authors investigated the possible synergistic and antagonistic interactions between the specific job resources. Findings The authors found that managers' leadership and humor style, their relationship with subordinates and coworkers' support had positive effects on employees' coping with job stress. In addition, the authors found that the manager's leadership style interacts with manager-subordinate relationship quality and coworkers' support as well as the latter interacts with the manager's humor style and manager-subordinate relationship quality. The study model explained 50% of the variance in effective coping with stress ratings. Originality/value The study highlights the importance of workplace resources as contextual variables, for the effective coping with stress symptoms at work. It highlights that a combination of workplace resources produces a net effect that was better than would have been expected based solely on the individual performance of these job resources. As such, the research answer calls to attend to the effects of synergistic effects of workplace resources on effective coping with stress symptoms at work.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2021-0275;Dead-end jobs or steppingstones? Precarious work in Albania. Purpose This study asks whether lower quality forms of employment lead to career transitions into higher quality forms of employment acting as steppingstones, or bridges or, whether instead they lead to dead-ends, or traps, in which workers move between unstable jobs with low prospects for upward mobility and unemployment. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a unique longitudinal dataset recording monthly employment states over 3 years for 373 individuals in the Albanian city of Shkoder. The analysis uses sequence and regression analysis to investigate whether people employed in lower quality, more precarious jobs remain in these kinds of jobs or instead are able to transition into higher quality, permanent and full-time employment. Findings In line with previous evidence for the region, the analysis confirms the precarization of many working lives particularly for women, young people and those with lower educational attainment. This evidence is more supportive of the dead-end hypothesis than the idea that a lower quality job can be a steppingstone into a better job. Originality/value This study contributes to the limited knowledge of labour market functioning in developing post-socialist Western Balkans countries. Recent flexicurity policies have generated an increased prevalence of more precarious employment arrangements in Albania. This investigation addresses previous research limitations regarding point-in-time transitions and unobserved heterogeneity using retrospective longitudinal data and controlling for personality traits.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-11-2020-0848;The buffering role of servant leadership on the relationship between organizational politics and employee task performance and citizenship behaviors. Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine whether servant leadership (SL) buffers the negative relationship between perceived organizational politics (POP) and employee performance outcomes. Design/methodology/approach Time-lagged multi source data were collected from 236 supervisor-subordinate dyads in a public sector university in Pakistan. SL, POP and several control variables were measured in subordinates at time 1, and supervisor ratings of organization citizenship behaviors and task performance were measured at time 2. The authors performed moderated multiple regression analysis to test the hypotheses underpinning the study. Findings Findings revealed that POP was negatively related to employee task performance and two types of organization citizenship behavior (individual and organizational). Findings also revealed that SL attenuated the negative effect of POP on employee task performance and the two types of organization citizenship behavior. Practical implications SL is particularly important in organizational cultures characterized by high politics;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2021-0019;How and when does humble leadership enhance newcomer well-being. Purpose Many studies have examined the positive outcomes of humble leadership for employees. However, its impact on newcomers' well-being has been rarely investigated. In this paper, based on affective events theory and the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions, the authors proposed a moderated mediation model to explore the effect of humble leadership on newcomer well-being. In the model, we identified newcomers' pride as a mediating variable and newcomers' proactive personality as a moderating variable. Design/methodology/approach The data were from a two-wave sample containing 213 newcomers. The hypothesized model was tested using partial least squares structural equational modeling. Findings The results demonstrated that humble leadership was positively related to newcomers' well-being, and newcomers' pride medicated this relationship. Additionally, newcomers' proactive personality moderated the relationship between humble leadership and newcomers' pride. Research limitations/implications The authors adopted a cross-sectional research design, rendering it difficult to derive causal relationships between variables. In addition, all data were from self-reports of newcomers which would suffer from common method variance. Originality/value This research examined the role of humble leadership in promoting newcomers' pride and well-being.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-03-2021-0170;The university-to-work transition: responses of universities and organizations to the COVID-19 pandemic. Purpose The purpose of this study is to understand how universities and organizations have responded to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of preparing university students and recent graduates to enter the global labor market, using the accounting, banking and finance sector as a case study. The two research questions are (1) How can university career services and organizations work individually and collaboratively to best develop early career talent following the COVID-19 pandemic? (2) What are the challenges that university career services and organizations face when working individually or collaboratively to develop early career talent following the COVID-19 pandemic? Design/methodology/approach The data for thematic analysis comes from 36 semi-structured interviews with career advisors (CAs) (n = 19) and graduate recruiters (GRs) (n = 17). Findings This study offers some of the first findings on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, helping to ensure that organizational behavior and career theory literature reflect the dramatically changing landscape in the university-to-work transition. Originality/value Theoretically, our contribution comes from applying a framework of the career construction theory (CTT) within the context of a career ecosystem to understand the views of the intermediary, meso-level actors, which, to date, have lacked representation within career literature. Practically, we provide an insightful bridge between universities and organizations, offering opportunities for greater collaboration, and enhanced outcomes for all stakeholders.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2020-0309;Who will pay for customers' fault? Workplace cheating behavior, interpersonal conflict and traditionality. Purpose Despite workplace cheating behavior is common and costly, little research has explored its antecedents from customers' perspective. The current study aims to investigate the indirect mechanisms between customer mistreatment and cheating behavior, and exam the moderated role of traditionality. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on conservation of resources theory, the authors examine how customer mistreatment affects workplace cheating behavior. They test their hypotheses using a time-lagged field study of 183 employees. Findings The results show that customer mistreatment is positively related to interpersonal conflict with customers, which positively affects workplace cheating behavior. Traditionality moderates the indirect effect of customer mistreatment on workplace cheating behavior. Originality/value This study calls for researchers' attention to exploring the antecedents of workplace cheating behavior from customers' perspective, and first provides empirical evidence on the relationship between customer mistreatment and workplace cheating behavior, which has never been examined.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2020-0484;Shaping emotional contagion in healthcare: the role of human resource practices and work harassment. Purpose This research examines the extent to which emotional contagions are shaped by human resource practices (HRPs) and work harassment and the influence of this on employee well-being and innovative behaviour. Design/methodology/approach The authors examined a structural equation model, including two waves of survey data from 240 healthcare professionals to explore the statistical associations between the tested variables. Findings The results do not show support for a significant relationship linking HRPs with work harassment. However, a significant positive effect linking HRPs, positive contagion, well-being and innovative behaviour was noted, in addition to a significant negative link from harassment on positive contagion, well-being and innovation behaviour. Originality/value The research highlights the limited role that HRPs (alone) play in mitigating harassment and their deleterious effects. Notwithstanding, HRPs can have a positive role in shaping the positive contagions and subsequent positive effects on employee and work outcomes.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2020-0362;Leaving on a jet plane? The effect of challenge-hindrance stressors, emotional resilience and cultural novelty on self-initiated expatriates' decision to exit China. Purpose The number of self-initiated expatriates (SIEs) is growing, yet we know relatively little about their work experiences, especially how they react to stress. The purpose of this study is to examine whether challenge and hindrance stressors influence SIEs' intent to remain as well as the possible influence of emotional resilience and cultural novelty upon these relationships. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 249 SIEs working in China. Findings As hypothesized, hindrance stressors were negatively related to the SIEs' intent to remain. Contrary to expectations, challenge stressors were not associated with intent to remain. Hindrance (challenge) stressors were negatively (positively) related to emotional resilience, and resilience mediated the relationship between stressors and intent to remain. Cultural novelty failed to moderate the relationship between emotional resilience and intent to remain and did not moderate the mediated effects of challenge stressors on intent to remain via emotional resilience. Cultural novelty did moderate the mediated effects of hindrance stressors on intent to remain via emotional resilience, but not in the hypothesized direction. Research limitations/implications This study was cross-sectional. It examined SIEs working in China, and its findings may not be generalizable to SIEs working in other countries. Originality/value This is the first study to examine how emotional resilience may mediate the relationship between stressors and SIEs' intent to remain and also considered the possible moderating effects of cultural novelty.

10.1108/PR-11-2021-0793;Opportunistic silence: ignited by psychological contract breach, instigated by hostile attribution bias. PurposeDrawing on social exchange literature, this study explores the mediating role of affective commitment between employees' assessments of contract breaches and opportunistic silence, along with the invigorating effect of hostile attribution bias.Design/methodology/approachWe tested the hypotheses using multi-wave data collected from employees working in higher education institutions in Pakistan.FindingsPerceived contract breaches elicit intentional, selfish and retaliatory motives of silence, largely because employees lack emotional attachments to their organization. This mechanism is more prominent among employees who tend to blame others and perceive them as antagonistic even when they are not.Practical implicationsFor human resource managers, this investigation highlights a crucial feature - affective commitment - by which employees' perceptions of psychological contract breaches facilitate opportunistic silence. Our results suggest that this process is more likely to intensify when employees have distorted thinking, motivating them to attribute the worst motives to their employer's actions.Social implicationsPerceived contract breaches within universities can have far-reaching societal consequences, affecting trust, reputation, economic stability, and the overall quality and accessibility of education and research. Addressing and preventing such breaches is essential to maintaining the positive societal role of universities.Originality/valueThis study provides novel insights into the process that underlies the connection between perceived contract breach and opportunistic silence by revealing the hitherto overlooked role of employees' hostile attribution bias, which renders them more susceptible to experiencing unfavorable forms of social exchange.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-09-2022-0660;Digitisation and automation in training and development: a meta-review of new opportunities and challenges. PurposeTo remain competitive, efficient and productive, organisations need to ensure that their employees continuously learn and develop. This is even more challenging and critical in times characterised by volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity (VUCA). Hence, several technological applications have been introduced with the promise to make organisational training and development (T&D) more efficient and targeted through digitisation and automation. However, digitising and automating processes in the sensitive field of T&D also poses challenges and perils for employees and organisations as a whole.Design/methodology/approachStructured by the T&D process of (1) assessment/planning, (2) design/implementation and (3) evaluation, the authors present different digitisation and automation possibilities and discuss the specific opportunities and challenges they pose. Subsequently, the authors identify and discuss overarching themes of opportunities and challenges of technology use in T&D via a meta-review.FindingsThis synthesis revealed three central topics that decision-makers in T&D should carefully consider when it comes to the implementation of technological applications: opportunities and challenges of (1) data collection, (2) decision-making and (3) the value of human contact.Originality/valueThis review integrates previously fragmented research on specific technologies applied to specific T&D functions and provides researchers and practitioners with a fuller picture of the opportunities and challenges of technology applied in T&D.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

PurposeThis study aims to examine the effect of firm-specific skills on formal and informal training and development (T & D) effectiveness, job satisfaction, turnover intentions, and the moderating effect of job tenure on each hypothesized path. The authors adopt a micro perspective on human capital, arguing its significance to examine the role of job attitudes in developing firm-specific skills.Design/methodology/approachA total of 1,514 South Korean workers' responses were obtained from the Human Capital Corporate Panel dataset. This study conducted structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the structural relationships between the study variables. A subsequent multigroup SEM was conducted to determine whether the structural model differed across job tenures by comparing the results for employees with more than and less than six years of tenure.FindingsThe findings indicate that (a) firm-specific skills have a negative effect on formal T & D effectiveness and no significant effect on informal T & D effectiveness;art; (d) informal T & D effectiveness has a positive effect on job satisfaction and no significant effect on turnover intentions;" and (e) job tenure partially moderates the relationships among the proposed study variables.Originality/valueThe study's findings provide new insights into human capital theory, focusing on whether firm-specific skills can be a source of sustained competitive advantage from employees' perspectives."",art";;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-08-2020-0634;Collectively crafting the sales job: linking charismatic leadership to sales teams' performance. Purpose - Irrespective of the importance of collective job crafting for team performance, its antecedents have not been fully comprehended. Drawing upon social cognitive theory, this study proposes that sales managers' charismatic leadership interacts with collective proactive personality in predicting collective job crafting, which in turn influences sales teams' customer relationship performance and financial performance. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 481 sales employees and 64 sales managers from 64 sales departments of tour companies. These multi-source data were analyzed through structural equation modeling.Findings - The findings revealed that charismatic leadership was positively associated with sales teams' collective job crafting, which was in turn positively related to sales teams' customer relationship performance and financial performance. Collective proactive personality negatively moderated the impact of charismatic leadership on collective job crafting. Originality/value - This study advances the extant knowledge by identifying the role of collective job crafting in translating charismatic leadership into sales teams' performance.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1108/PR-09-2022-0588;Should I pet or should I work? Human-animal interactions and (tele)work engagement: an exploration of the underlying within-level mechanisms. PurposeHuman-animal interactions (HAIs) have been found to have an extensive and significant influence on individuals' well-being and health-related outcomes. However, there are few studies that examine this influence on work-related contexts, such as teleworking. In this study, the author relied on the affective events theory to examine the effect of daily HAI on employees' daily work engagement and the underlying mechanisms (daily affect ratio and state mindfulness), by resorting to a daily diary study.Design/methodology/approachTo test the hypotheses, the author collected daily data during five consecutive working days with pet owners (N = 400 x 5 = 2,000).FindingsMultilevel results showed that interacting with pets during the working day was positively associated with daily work engagement, but this positive relationship was stronger for individuals with lower levels of mindfulness. Further analyses showed that the daily affect ratio mediated the moderating effect of mindfulness on the relationship between daily interactions with pets and daily work engagement.Practical implicationsThese findings provide strong support for the proposed mediated moderation model;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2022-0281;Family incivility, work alienation beliefs and submissive behaviors among Pakistani employees: the mitigating role of ego resilience. PurposeThis research seeks to unpack a relevant, hitherto overlooked connection between employees' perception that family incivility is undermining their work and their displays of submissive behavior. The authors predict and test a mediating role of employees' work alienation beliefs and a moderating role of their ego resilience in this connection.Design/methodology/approachThe research hypotheses were tested with survey data collected in three rounds, separated by three weeks each, among employees who work in the education sector in Pakistan. The statistical analyses relied on the PROCESS macro, which supports the simultaneous estimation of the direct, mediation and moderated mediation effects that underpin the proposed theoretical framework.FindingsAn important reason that victims of disrespectful treatment at home fail to fight for their rights at work is that they develop parallel beliefs of being disconnected from work. This intermediary role of work alienation beliefs is less prominent though when employees can rely on their personal resource of ego resilience.Practical implicationsFor human resource (HR) managers, this research offers a critical explanation, related to a sense of being estranged from work, for why family-induced work hardships might cause employees to exhibit subservient behaviors at work. It further reveals how this process can be contained if employees have the capability to adapt flexibly to different situations.Originality/valueThis study contributes to extant research by explicating how and when family-induced work hardships might escalate into work responses that mirror employees' experiences at home.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1108/PR-11-2021-0808;Work from anywhere: remote stakeholder management and engagement. Purpose The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly disrupted the traditional ways for organizations to function, mandating their prompt adaptation and reaction to issues related to employees, operations, and communication. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to report on a total quality management (TQM) implementation as a sample motivational case to support the need for a new work from anywhere (WFA) stakeholder framework that can be used by other companies as they build, maintain, and continuously improve a WFA culture and environment for successful Quality 4.0 and COVID-19 initiatives. Design/methodology/approach Quality 4.0 that specifies an adaptive quality environment can help organizations quickly identify and respond to problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyzing a Lean Six Sigma implementation through the lens of Quality 4.0 in a case study, the authors propose a new stakeholder engagement framework for companies to build, maintain, and continuously improve the culture and environment for facilitating social interactions. Findings The authors' proposed framework consists of three major phases: (1) identify and plan stakeholder management, (2) manage stakeholder engagement, and (3) sustain stakeholder engagement. The first phase entails organizations supporting a culture of trust, engaging, and empowering stakeholders, identifying stakeholders, planning for stakeholder management, and inquiring about problems in the process. The second phase requires engaging stakeholders via participatory buy-in. The third phase focuses on monitoring stakeholder relationships, including modifying strategies and plans. Practical implications This study bears some valuable implications for practitioners. First, the stakeholder management process should be established upon a culture that promotes trust, engagement, and empowerment. Second, the authors identify tools that can assist in the execution of WFA activities. Third, the organizational team needs to actively manage the WFA stakeholders and then sustain the stakeholder relationships. Finally, the implementation of the framework herein can be supported and strengthened by tools and techniques that promote participation and buy-in from stakeholders to ensure the project team hears, trusts, and values their contributions. Originality/value This study contributes to the existing literature and provides practical guidance for managers to effectively manage the workforce and engage stakeholders.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2021-0704;Employer's investments in job crafting to promote knowledge worker's sustainable employability: a moderated mediation model. Purpose The primary study purpose is to examine whether managerial support triggers job crafting and sustainable employability, and to what extent work uncertainty moderates the managerial support and sustainable employability relationships mediated by job crafting using a moderated mediation approach. Thus, this study aims to uncover new antecedent and outcomes of job crafting using job demands and resources (JD-R) theory as no such research has yet examined these relationships. Design/methodology/approach The structural equation modeling (SEM) technique was employed to test the proposed relationships based on survey data that include a final 483 knowledge workers of the services sector. The authors tested the structural model using self-developed estimates for AMOS 24.0 to examine the moderated mediation process models (process models 7, 14 and 58) rather than using a conventional process macro through SPSS. Findings Consistent with the formulated hypothesis, the results of this study indicate that managerial support directly stimulates job crafting and sustainable employability. Further, job crafting mediates the relationships between managerial support and sustainable employability. This validates the JD-R theory assumption that managerial support as job resources initiates a motivational process through job crafting, leading to sustainable employability as the outcome of the motivational process. Additionally, the moderated mediation results show that in the presence of high work uncertainty, employees are more engaged in job crafting to boost their sustainable employability. Practical implications Organizations may incorporate these findings while developing human resources (HR) management policies and practices to align top-down and bottom-up job re(design) approaches. For example, by designing line managers' role in implementation of supportive HR practices, their supportive leadership behavior towards employees will successfully trigger job crafting and nurture their sustainable employability. Originality/value This research adds to the work design and employability literature. No such study has yet examined whether managerial support triggers job crafting and sustainable employability. Prior studies examine personality traits, some individual difference variable, job characteristics, or leadership influence as antecedents of job crafting. Utilizing the JD-R theory, we empirically validate that job crafting plays a vital role in the motivational process initiated by the job resources (managerial support), leading to sustainable employability as an outcome of the motivational process. The authors further show that in the presence of high job demands (work uncertainty), employees are more engaged in job crafting and more conscious to boost their sustainable employability.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Purpose This article illustrates the experiences of employee resource group (ERG) members over a two-year period with the aim of understanding the benefits and risks of membership for sexual minority employees. Design/methodology/approach Qualitative interview data were collected from seven lesbian, gay or bisexual ERG members following an extreme case approach at two points in time separated by two years. Findings Three themes of outcomes related to ERG membership emerged from the data. Participants reported both benefits and risks associated with the social and career-related consequences of membership. The role that allies play in providing visibility, legitimacy and support to ERG members also emerged and shifted in importance over the two years between interviews, with ally involvement becoming more important to career outcomes over time. Practical implications This study illuminates potential consequences of supporting ERGs for minority employees, as well as insight into the role of allies in these groups. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature by revealing several individual outcomes of a growing form of diversity management practice: ERGs.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-12-2020-0912;How does the power dynamics in the information technology outsourcing supply chain influence supplier's talent retention: a multiple case study. Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the power dynamics between the client firm and the supplier firm in the information technology outsourcing (ITO) supplier chain influence the supplier firm's human resource management (HRM) practices, particularly talent retention. Design/methodology/approach A multi-case study approach was adopted comprising four supplier firms, three client firms and a total of 53 interviews. The transaction cost economics (TCE) is the theoretical lens that guides the interpretation of our findings. Findings The power dynamics between client and supplier firms in the ITO supply chain is one underpinned by TCE theory, characterised by an asymmetric client-dominated, transactional relationship, with the client firms controlling the why, the what, and the how dimensions of their collaboration. This three-dimensional control led to high talent turnover in supplier firms, which boomerangs to perpetuate the power dynamic, forming vicious cycles of talent turnover in the ITO supplier chain. Originality/value No previous study has analysed power dynamics as an external factor on ITO supplier firms' talent retention. The construct of the three-dimensional-control offers a framework to study power dynamics in the ITO supplier chain. The study's framework of the vicious cycles of talent turnover is the first that explains the mechanisms through which the power dynamics in the ITO influences supplier's talent retention.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1108/PR-03-2021-0174;When can felt accountability promote innovative work behavior? The role of transformational leadership. Purpose Studies have reported negative effects of felt accountability on employees' extra-role behavior. Deviating from that focus, this study proposes that leadership plays a role in shaping the implications of felt accountability for employees' extra-role behavior. We propose that under high transformational leadership, felt accountability can motivate employees to engage in task-relevant information elaboration and facilitate innovative work behavior, a form of extra-role behavior that seeks to improve the work environment. Design/methodology/approach We conducted a pilot study to validate measurements of felt accountability and task-relevant information elaboration in a sample of 202 employees. We then conducted the main study using a time-lagged, multisource survey design with a sample of 120 supervisor-employee pairs. Findings The results from the main study reveal that the association between felt accountability and task-related information elaboration is positive and stronger when transformational leadership is higher. Furthermore, task-relevant information elaboration positively predicts innovative work behavior. Finally, when transformational leadership is higher, the mediation effect of task-relevant information elaboration on the association between felt accountability and innovative work behavior is stronger. Originality/value Our study indicates that felt accountability can have positive implications for employees' extra-role behavior contingent on leadership styles. In contrast to previous studies that emphasize the negative implications of felt accountability on employees' behavior, our study depicts when and why felt accountability can have positive implications on employees' behavior.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1108/PR-04-2020-0262;Does leaders' adoption of employee voice influence employee work engagement?. Purpose The present study aims to determine the effect of adopting voice on subordinates' work engagement based on organization-based self-esteem (OBSE). Design/methodology/approach Three variables were rated according to the seven-point Likert-type response scales. To control the effect of common method variance, an online survey was conducted to collect data from 206 samples at Chinese firms by employing a two-wave and time-lagged approach. In addition, structure equation modeling analysis was adopted to verify the hypotheses with Mplus 7. Findings Leaders' adoption of employee voice shows a positive association with employee OBSE and work engagement. OBSE is positively associated with work engagement and mediates the effect of adopting voice on work engagement. Practical implications As suggested from the mentioned results, organizations are required to encourage leaders to adopt employees' reasonable voice that can be an effective management tool impacting employee work engagement. Originality/value Though existing studies have discussed the effects of leader behaviors on subordinates' work engagement, the effect of leaders' adoption of employee voice on employee work engagement has been rarely studied. Based on the job demand-resource model, this study fills the gap by empirically examining the effect of adopting voice on work engagement. As indicated by the findings here, leaders' adoption of employee voice enhances employee OBSE, thereby facilitating work engagement. The present study provides insights to stimulate employee work engagement.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-09-2023-0796;Work autonomy and exit-voice choice: the role of skill utilization, learning from colleagues and future time orientation. PurposeUnderpinned by the exit-voice and work design models, this study investigates how work autonomy reduces employee turnover intentions and promotes voice behavior via the mediator of skill utilization and how this mediation process is moderated by social (learning from colleagues) and personality (future time orientation) characteristics.Design/methodology/approachThe hypothesized moderated mediation model was tested using regression analysis based on two-wave survey data of 350 Chinese employees.FindingsThe relationships between work autonomy on the one hand and voice behavior and turnover intentions on the other were mediated by skill utilization. Furthermore, such mediated relationships were intensified by collegial learning and future time orientation.Practical implicationsAdopting empowering HR practices (e.g. autonomous work teams and job rotation) that give employees job control and learning opportunities is important to encourage employee voice and reduce turnover.Originality/valueThe paper identifies collegial learning and future time orientation as boundary conditions that regulate the effects of work autonomy. This reconciles the contradictory findings in prior research testing the relationship between autonomy and exit-voice decisions.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Purpose - Human Resource Management (HRM) is a critical organizational function, which has continued to evolve. We aim to explore how different HRM will be in the workplace of the future and why, from both strategic and practical perspectives. We present and discuss core HRM practices, such as recruitment, selection and training, as well as peripheral activities, such as monitoring health and safety, and diversity management, reflecting on how they may transform in the workplace of the future. Design/methodology/approach - This is a conceptual thought piece, building on the Substitution, Augmentation, Modification and Redefinition (SAMR) model, to offer a futuristic view of HRM in the era of AI. Findings - Discussing the contemporary challenges of Artificial Intelligence, which we predict will lead to what we term Cyborging HRM. Practical implicationsThis study can help HR managers and practitioners to be prepared for AI-embedded HRM systems in the future. For academics, it offers an innovative framework to establish future writing on HRM in the AI era. Originality/value - AI is pushing HRM and the profession will have to undergo a revolutionary rather than evolutionary transformation in order to remain a necessary and valuable function for organizations.

PurposeThe paper aims to clarify the relationship between organizational work-family practices and employee work-family conflict in light of the boundary conditions of commitment-based human resource management (HRM) and employee human capital.Design/methodology/approachThe paper opted for a multi-source, multi-level design and surveyed 1,717 individuals (including CEOs, HR managers and employees) from 159 firms in China. The model was tested using hierarchical linear modeling.FindingsThe paper provides empirical insights that the effect of work-family practices on work-family conflict is indispensably dependent on the adoption of commitment-based HRM. In addition, employee human capital further moderated this interaction in that the effect of work-family practices on reducing work-family conflict was most salient with high-education employees who were embedded in a high-commitment HRM system.Research limitations/implicationsTesting the hypotheses in the Chinese context has both its merits and drawbacks. Specific results are pursuant to the Chinese context. Therefore, a cross-cultural comparative study is called upon.Practical implicationsThe paper includes implications for organizations striving to minimize employee work-family conflict.Originality/valueThis paper primarily applies the resource-building perspective to examine the synergistic effects of organizational resources (targeting work-family practices together with general commitment-based HRM) and individual intellectual resources (human capital) on employee work family conflict.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1108/PR-04-2023-0286;Retirement decisions in times of COVID-19: the role of telework, ICT-related strain and social support on older workers' intentions to continue working. PurposeThe COVID-19 pandemic forced many employees to work from home, resulting in new demands that might cause older workers to reevaluate their retirement decisions. Building on the extended Job Demands-Resources model, which explains work-related outcomes in times of crisis, this study investigated the change in older workers' intention to continue working during COVID-19 and the role of ICT-related strain and social support during teleworking.Design/methodology/approachA two-wave longitudinal study was conducted among 1,406 older workers (i.e. 50 years or older). Data were collected before the COVID-19 pandemic (2019: T1) and during the pandemic (2021: T2). In total, 967 older workers completed the survey at both waves.FindingsOlder workers' nearing retirement experienced a decline in intentions to continue working during the pandemic, while intentions of older workers further away from their retirement increased. At T2, the negative relationship between telework intensity and the intention to continue working was mediated by ICT-related strain. Perceived social support at work seems to buffer the negative impact of telework intensity on ICT-related strain.Originality/valueThis study provides valuable insights into factors that may stimulate older workers' workforce participation by investigating effects of ICT-related strain and social support during telework. Organizations can implement interventions that enhance job resources and reduce job demands during telework to help mitigate ICT-related strain and postpone retirement.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2020-0377;How hard can it be? A qualitative study following an HRT implementation in a global industrial corporate group. PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to critically study the implementation and contextualization of the human resource transformation (HRT) management model within the human resources (HR) function of a global industrial company group.Design/methodology/approachA qualitative case study that includes two data collections.FindingsImplementation of the HRT model led to tensions and conflicting interpretations of the mission of the HR function, and a tug of war about the distribution of work both within HR and between HR and line management. Splitting the HR function into three legs made the HR function's learning cycles more difficult. The corporate group had a decentralized and diverse business culture, and contextualization of the HRT model to this setting highlighted the model's embeddedness in the American business culture of centralization and standardization. Implementation of the model also entailed a transition from an employee to an employer perspective within HR.Research limitations/implicationsFor an assessment of HR's total work other parts of the HRT model (Ulrich and Brockbank, 2005) need to be involved since HR professionals in the insourced or outsourced shared service center (SSC) and Center of Expertise (CoE) and the e-HR tools are equally important for executing the total HR's mission. Further studies of the problematic human resource business partner (HRBP) role are needed and also what the development of e-HR solutions means for the HR profession.Practical implicationsThe authors argue for a continuous development of HR work, along with closer professional contact both with line managers (LMs) and within the HR function, for improved learning cycles and a need for contextualization when implementing management models.Social implicationsThe paper discusses the HRT model's impact on HR practitioners' and LMs' work practice.Originality/valueThis article shows the need for contextualization when implementing management models. The lack of such contextualization led to severe tensions, and the intentions of an efficient and respected HR function were not achieved. The study contributes an evaluation of the tensions between HRT as a normative and standardized model in business settings accustomed to variety and decentralized decision-making.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-08-2021-0597;Creatures of a lesser god! Gender-based differences in HR attributions mediated by person-job fit: a poly-contextual analysis. Purpose Using social information processing and sense-making theory, the current study examines how the poly-contextual factors and social environment of employees provide unique cues and shape an employee's person-job (PJ) fit perceptions in ways that enable males to perceive a better PJ fit than their female counterparts at work. These perceptions of PJ fit act as mediating processes between gender-based differences in HR commitment or HR control attributions. Design/methodology/approach After collecting two waves of data over a six-month period from a sample of 498 banking sector professionals in Pakistan, the hypothesized relationships were tested using hierarchical multiple regression. Findings It was found that gender (female) was positively related to HR control attributions and negatively related to PJ fit perceptions and HR commitment attributions. The mean differences between males and females concerning these study variables were significant. Also, PJ fit mediated the relationship between gender and HR attributions. Originality/value The study contributes to the advancement and understanding of the predictors of HR attributions by examining the poly-contextual factors that shape unique experiences, knowledge structures and social information processing, thus forming distinct PJ fit perceptions and subsequent HR commitment or control attributions for males and females.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of job seekers' perceived incivility during job search on their job search intensity via job search-specific self-esteem, and to explore how the job seekers' level of dispositional mindfulness buffers these relationships. Design/methodology/approach Using self-report measures, time-lagged data were obtained from 242 graduating students of a Chinese university. Findings Results showed that perceived incivility during job search was negatively related to job search-specific self-esteem, and that job search-specific self-esteem was positively related to job search intensity. Further, dispositional mindfulness mitigated the direct link between perceived incivility and job search-specific self-esteem and the indirect link between job seekers' perception of incivility and job search intensity through job search-specific self-esteem. Originality/value By integrating the recruitment and job search literature, we investigated how negative experiences (perceived incivility during recruitment) stemming from the context of job search influence the motivation of job seekers to continue their job search via the mediating role of job search-specific self-esteem. Further, for the first time, we explored the moderating role of dispositional mindfulness in the job search literature by utilizing the framework of positive psychology.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-12-2020-0872;What sort of collective bargaining is emerging in Nigeria?. Purpose Nigeria is experiencing an expanding variety of what is termed collective bargaining, which is being propelled by socio-economic challenges and the emerging political dispensation that had long eluded the country, albeit the numerous contours needing some pragmatic approaches from the state, employers of labour and the trade unions at the local and national levels. Therefore, this study represents an attempt to illustrate the rising collective bargaining pattern in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach This study drew on employee and employer sectoral associations examples together with labour union structures of the state to assess what underlined collective bargaining developments from the broad context of collective bargaining and the industrial relations implications. Content analysis was employed to analyse the secondary data (found in relevant company handbooks, policies, collective agreements, etc.) and primary data obtained through unstructured interviews. Findings A form of collective bargaining is emerging where the trade unions are embracing symbiotic agreements at plant levels to improve conditions of employment and thus weakening the hold of the national union from collective bargaining - a move that may challenge the conceptual framework of collective bargaining as conceived by many states in developing economies. Originality/value This is an investigative paper, carefully trailing the framework of collective bargaining from direct contacts with all stakeholders in the labour corridors of Nigeria - such as the Nigeria Labour Congress, Nigeria Employers' Consultative Association, Chemical and Non-Metallic Products Employer's Federation, Metal Products Workers Union of Nigeria and Personnel Practitioners, cutting across all the segments of the political and economic development of the country.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2021-0330;A moderated mediation model of counterproductive work behaviour, organisational justice, organisational embeddedness and psychological ownership. Purpose This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms through which organisational justice influences counterproductive work behaviour (CWB). This relationship was explained using a moderated mediation model where organisational embeddedness is a mediator between organisational justice and CWB, while psychological ownership (for the organisation) is a moderator of the relationship between organisational embeddedness and CWB. The conservation of resources (COR) theory was used as the underpinning theory to explain the interrelationships among the constructs. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected by administering a quantitative cross-sectional survey to employees of Punjab Police, a large public sector, law enforcement organisation in Pakistan. The study model was analysed using PLS-SEM to address the treatment of higher-order reflective-formative constructs. Findings The results showed that organisational justice is positively related to organisational embeddedness, while organisational embeddedness is negatively related to CWB. Organisational embeddedness was found to play a significant role in mediating the negative effects of organisational justice on CWB. Also, psychological ownership moderated the influence of organisational embeddedness on CWB in an interesting fashion. CWB was the highest when both embeddedness and ownership were low;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Purpose The purpose of this article is to examine the communicative factors that facilitate or hamper the development of an inclusive work environment with an emphasis on the communication about equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI), while taking diversity characteristics of employees into account. Design/methodology/approach In total, 84 persons employed in Austria and Germany, who feature various observable and non-observable diversity characteristics, were interviewed following a problem-centered approach. Findings The results indicate that employees with (observable) diversity characteristics, who tend to feel less included, observe more excluding and marginalizing communication and practices in their organizations. Moreover, formal interpersonal communication appears to be more important to develop a highly inclusive workplace than informal interpersonal communication and other forms of communication about EDI. Research limitations/implications The sample was rather imbalanced and comprised only employees in Austria and Germany, which limits the study's explanatory power. However, the findings stress the significance of formal interpersonal communication as the cornerstone of an inclusive workplace, which should be followed up in future research. Practical implications In terms of the development of an inclusive work environment the findings suggest that strategic (i.e. formal) organizational communication about EDI issues is key to increase the perception of inclusion. Originality/value This paper contributes to the literature by demonstrating the importance of interpersonal communication as a key factor that facilitates, but also hampers an inclusive work environment.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-09-2019-0483;Drivers of intrapreneurship: an affective events theory viewpoint. Purpose In the current study framework, the authors test the underlying assumptions of affective events theory concerning the impact of job satisfaction and job insecurity driven by incivility on intrapreneurial behaviour. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected with a sample of 510 employees from five organisations. All hypotheses were tested via SmartPLS3. Additionally, a distinction between formative and reflective measures was performed. Findings Findings revealed that incivility decreases intrapreneurial behaviour, mediated by job satisfaction and job insecurity. Additionally, this study's results show that the relationship between job satisfaction and job insecurity and intrapreneurial behaviour distinguishes unionised employees from employees who are not unionised. Research limitations/implications The cross-sectional nature of the present data precluded definitive statements about causality. Additionally, further studies should increase the sample size and include an international perspective to ensure the overall generalisability of the results. Practical implications Practically, this study's findings point to the need for organisational management to understand better underlying employees' perceptions and their antecedents and consequences. Originality/value The study results contribute to the literature by testing the core assumptions of affective events theory and by extending the affective events theory model, incorporating contextual influences on the relationship between attitudes and behaviours. The authors also show for the first time that incivility can be directly (compared to indirectly) linked to emotional-based responses, but not to those responses driven by cognitive appraisals. Thus, the study also contributes to the incivility literature and the understanding of various antecedents and consequences of incivility. Additionally, this study addressed the notion of formative versus reflective measurement models for the first time relating to incivility and intrapreneurial behaviour, allowing for more sensitive and less biased results. Herein lies an additional methodological contribution.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22102;Surviving remotely: How job control and loneliness during a forced shift to remote work impacted employee work behaviors and well-being. This paper investigates the impact of job control and work-related loneliness on employee work behaviors and well-being during the massive and abrupt move to remote work amid the COVID-19 pandemic. We draw on job-demands control and social baseline theory to link employee perceived job control and work-related loneliness to emotional exhaustion and work-life balance and posit direct and indirect effects on employee minor counterproductive work behaviors, depression, and insomnia. Using a two-wave data collection with a sample of U.S. working adults to test our predictions, we find that high job control was beneficially related to emotional exhaustion and work-life balance, while high work-related loneliness showed detrimental relationships with our variables of interest. Moreover, we find that the beneficial impact of high perceived job control was conditional on individual segmentation preferences such that the effects were stronger when segmentation preference was low. Our research extends the literature on remote work, job control, and workplace loneliness. It also provides insights for human resource professionals to manage widespread remote work that is likely to persist long after the COVID-19 pandemic.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22095;Navigating the era of disruption: How emotions can prompt job crafting behaviors. Environmental disruptions can disturb the status quo. This can create the need for employees to navigate rapidly evolving demands in their work environment, often before formalized strategic plans can be developed and/or implemented. As such, understanding how employees experience and respond to these disruptions is critical for effective strategic human resource management. Drawing on appraisal theories of emotion, we argue that employees' appraisals of how the disruption has impacted their work can elicit discrete emotions (e.g., frustration and pride). In turn, these emotions can encourage employees to address challenges and opportunities by engaging in job crafting behaviors. Importantly, job crafting behaviors can have implications for subsequent employee outcomes (e.g., performance and well-being). We test our predictions using a three-wave survey (N = 402) in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic-an unexpected environmental disruption that sparked rapid change. Theoretically, our findings provide insight into why and how employees can self-initiate changes to their jobs in response to environmental disruptions as well as how job crafting behaviors impact employee outcomes. Practically, our findings provide insight and guidance to SHRM practitioners on how to effectively support and manage employees before, during, and after environmental disruptions.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22211;Dark side of algorithmic management on platform worker behaviors: A mixed-method study. This research investigates the impact of algorithmic management on worker behaviors, focusing on workers' commitment to service quality and referral tendencies. Drawing upon the job demands-resources model, we argue that high levels of algorithmic management could create hindrance demands that impede service quality and demotivate referral behaviors. We propose that high workload, as a challenge demand, buffers the negative effects of algorithmic management on worker outcomes. We find support for our proposed research model in an experiment with a sample of 1362 platform-based food-delivery riders. We also conduct a qualitative study with 21 riders, which provides a more nuanced understanding of how algorithmic management affects workers' attitudes, behaviors, and referral tendencies.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22208;An examination of whether and how leader humility enhances leader personal career success. Humble leaders are traditionally thought to create a great deal of human and social capital, yet be overshadowed by self-promoting rivals for promotions. We propose that through informal career mentoring, humble leaders can improve their organizational status and promotability. We tested our model among a multisource sample of 610 leaders across 18 industries and 21 job functions who participated in a leader development program. Leader humility was reported by the focal leaders' peers, leader mentoring behavior was reported by the focal leaders' direct reports, leader status was reported by the focal leaders' immediate bosses, and leader promotability was reported by the focal leaders' superiors. Results generally confirmed that leader humility predicted leader mentoring behavior, which in turn predicted leader status, and ultimately higher leader promotability ratings. We discuss how our findings extend and enrich the literatures on leader humility and mentoring, showing how humble leaders can ascend organizational hierarchies.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22203;Power to the people-And then? A multilevel leadership perspective on organizational decentralization. As organizations strive for more flexibility, decentralized decision-making has been at the core of many modern HR approaches. Yet, on a company-wide scale, it remains unclear whether decentralized decision-making structures improve organizational performance. Our study aims to illuminate prior ambiguous evidence by examining an employee-level mechanism underlying the organizational-level relationship between decentralization and performance, and scrutinizing the critical role of formal leaders for empowering employees in decentralized structures. Integrating the perspective of organizational structure as opportunities and constraints with social information processing theory, we argue that transferring decision-making authority to lower organizational levels positively affects employees' emergent leadership, but only to the extent that direct supervisors engage in empowering leadership and guide employees' behaviors in decentralized structures. Our predictions are supported by a multilevel, multisource field study of 5807 individuals across 144 companies. We further find that emergent leadership yields a positive effect on organizational performance. By developing a multilevel model that explicates both an employee-level mechanism and a contingency of the decentralization-organizational performance link, our study enriches understanding of the key role that formal leaders play for achieving the strategic goals of decentralized decision-making in organizations.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22146;Strong signals in HR management: How the configuration and strength of an HR system explain the variability in HR attributions. In explaining the effectiveness of a human resource (HR) system within an organization, scholars have turned their attention to HR attributions, which capture employees' perceptions about the intentions behind their organization's HR practices, and have demonstrated that an HR system's content and process of communication drive employees to form specific HR attributions. However, current research has not yet explained why HR attributions differ among employees. We investigate the variability in HR attributions among individuals and the organizational factors that influence this variability. Using signaling theory and the concept of situational strength, we argue that employees' HR attributions vary less when signals sent by HR management are unambiguous and the conveyed information is consistent. Using an online scenario-based experiment with 760 participants, our findings reveal that the configuration and the strength of an HR system as well as their combination have significant effects on the variability in HR attributions among employees, and these effects differ for the different HR attributions.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22135;The multiple roles of network ties in the employee job search process. Employee water cooler conversations with coworkers, as well as interpersonal interactions outside of one's employing organization, are key sources of information about the labor market. Although the value of network ties for job search is well recognized, research to date has tended to focus on how network ties relate to job search outcomes, providing little insight into what types of network ties offer information that shape job seeker perceptions and behaviors throughout the job search process. Drawing from Steel's (2002) evolutionary search model and social network research, we assert that different types of network ties-those that are weak versus strong and those internal versus external to the organization-offer different types of labor market information, which impacts employees' labor market perceptions, propensity to search for employment, and job search effectiveness. Using a time-separated research design in a sample of healthcare workers, we find weak external ties are associated with more optimistic perceptions of the labor market, increased marketability, and early-stage job search, and strong external ties are associated with greater marketability and propensity to engage in an early-stage job search. Strong internal ties (SITs) have dual, opposing influences on employee job search: SITs are associated with less early-stage job search, but they are also associated with increased concrete prospects when employees are more actively seeking alternative employment. Taken together, this study provides more nuanced insights into how network ties influence employee job search processes, clarifying ambiguities in this literature.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22115;The HR ecosystem framework: Examining strategic HRM tensions in knowledge-intensive organizations with boundary-crossing professionals. In this article, we use Snell & Morris' (2021) new HR ecosystem framework to empirically examine strategic fit and alignment tensions for knowledge-intensive organizations and professional knowledge workers. Rich data were collected through in-depth interviews with 75 members of faculty engaged in knowledge-intensive work for Business and Management Schools (B&M), and the analysis of strategy documents. The application of the framework enables us to contribute to dynamic capabilities theory and SHRM in four ways. Firstly, drawing on the findings, we propose an adapted HR Ecosystem framework for analyzing knowledge-intensive organizations, which incorporates tensions across the four subsystems of an HR ecosystem (strategy, capabilities, composition, and cultures). These tensions are shaped by interactions within and between levels (meso, macro and micro) and ecosystems. Secondly, our findings underscore the need for knowledge-intensive organizations to engage with a plurality of collaborative and competing internal and external stakeholder interests, including those of knowledge workers who constitute key organizational stakeholders. Thirdly, our analysis shows how the views and behaviors of internal organizational stakeholders are affected by ecosystem dynamics within and beyond the physical boundaries of an organization. Fourthly, we reveal how conflicting organizational cultures connect with other HR ecosystem subsystems to constrain collegialism and cohesion. By evidencing how knowledge-intensive organizations are in a constant flux of alignment and misalignment, the article demonstrates the value of the HR ecosystem framework in examining and informing SHRM in organizations in other industries.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22088;The dark side of leader-member exchange: Observers' reactions when leaders target their teammates for abuse. We draw on deonance theory and social learning theory to propose a framework that explains how individual team members with varying levels of leader-member exchange (LMX) with their team leader have different emotional and behavioral responses upon observing teammate-directed abusive supervision. After employing a social relations paradigm with two-wave round-robin data collected from a sample of 378 engineers on 89 work teams, we did not find that witnessing teammate-targeted abusive supervision increased sympathy for the targeted teammates, but we did find that observers with a higher level of LMX were more likely to legitimize such abuse and less likely to sympathize with its victims. Furthermore, we found that for individuals with a higher level of LMX, perceiving leaders' abusive supervision of teammates was negatively related to providing help to those teammates through the mediating role of sympathy for the teammates.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22251;Mistreated but Still Resilient! Unraveling the Role of Servant Leadership in Mitigating the Adverse Consequences of Care Recipients' Incivility. In many countries, social care workers suffer from mistreatment from social care recipients. Such mistreatment poses a significant challenge from the human resource management (HRM) perspective as finding and retaining competent social care workers is a global challenge. However, only a few studies focus on the relationship between such mistreatment and social care workers' job and psychological resources. Drawing on the conservation of resources (COR) theory, our study sheds light on the relationship between social care recipients' incivility and the resilience of social care workers. Specifically, our study examines the mediating role of work meaningfulness on the care recipient incivility-care worker resilience link, and the moderating role of servant leadership on this mediated relationship. To test the proposed moderated mediation model, two studies were conducted in social care organizations in England (n = 248) and Romania (n = 296). Our results revealed that perceived care recipient incivility is indirectly and negatively related to care workers' resilience by undermining their perceptions of work meaningfulness. Moreover, when social care workers work under a servant leader, this indirect relationship becomes weaker. The discussion elaborates on the findings of our model as well as the theoretical and practical implications for the management of human resources in social care organizations.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22219;When words are not enough: The combined effects of autism meta-stereotypes and recruitment practices aimed at attracting autistic job-seekers. Based on research on meta-stereotypes and signaling theory, we examined the effects of organizational signaling on the attraction of autistic applicants. Our model predicted that meta-stereotypes and the combination of expressed and evidence-based autism-conscious signals would have simple and joint effects on candidates' fit perceptions, which would, in turn, affect their job pursuit intentions. Further, we expected that the effect of signaling on our outcomes would be weaker among candidates with strong negative autism meta-stereotypes. Prior to testing our hypotheses, we conducted a focus group to determine the supports that autistic job seekers deemed most important. As the ability to work from home (WFH) was overwhelmingly the most cited support, we included this as our evidence-based signal. Specifically, we examined the combined effect of disability-conscious (vs. disability-blind) diversity statements and WFH (vs. retirement benefits) on expected fit and subsequent job pursuit intentions. Both meta-stereotypes and combined signals significantly influenced fit expectations. Further, the autism-friendly signals significantly affected the fit of candidates with weak and moderate negative meta-stereotype, but not the fit of candidates with strong meta-stereotypes. In addition, our results indicate that the signal x meta-stereotype interaction had an indirect effect on job pursuit intentions. Findings are discussed vis-a-vis the research on signaling theory and practical guidance is offered to employers seeking to attract the growing number of autistic job seekers.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22151;HR practices and work relationships: A 20 year review of relational HRM research. We systematically reviewed quantitative studies of phenomena at the nexus of Human Resource Management (HRM) and interpersonal relationships. We report on the overall prevalence and trends in research methods relating to construct, internal, external, and statistical conclusion validity. The review draws attention to areas of emphasis (positive relationships, instrumental ties, nonnetwork structures, employee respondents, samples drawn from Asia, HR perceptions). We also identify a growing emphasis on particularly desirable approaches to examining relational HRM (a more balanced consideration of positive and negative relationships, studies that examine more than one HR practice, multilevel analyses). Together, the identified areas of emphasis, gaps, and associated trends, inform our elucidation of research directions around 15 specific work relationships-along with more general directions for better accounting for dynamic, multilevel, measurement, and analytical considerations central to HRM and interpersonal relationships.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22119;The impact of organizational statements of support for the black community in the wake of a racial mega-threat on organizational attraction and revenue. When race-related injustices occur in society, organizations can respond by sending supportive signals to prospective and current employees. Using signaling theory (Spence, 1973), the current study examines the outcomes associated with organizations' public declarations of support for the Black community following race-related mega-threats (Leigh & Melwani, 2019). In Study 1, prospective employees evaluated a specific organization (Ben & Jerry's) that publicly supported the Black community following race-related mega-threats. Those who perceived higher levels of organizational support for diversity and inclusion (POSDI) reported higher organizational attraction (OA). Study 2 described a fictitious organization that responded to race-related mega-threats by messaging support for either Black Lives Matter (BLM), Blue Lives Matter, All Lives Matter, or no social movement. Prospective employees perceived higher levels of POSDI when the company issued a statement in support of BLM (relative to the other movements), which in turn was associated with higher OA. Study 3 focused on current employees and examined how POSDI influences financial outcomes in real Fortune 500 companies. Organizations that issued statements publicly supporting the Black community following a race-related mega-threat received higher POSDI ratings by employees, which predicted increased organizational revenue, even after controlling for revenue prior to making the statements. In sum, organizations that signal public support for the Black community in the wake of a race-related mega-threat not only increase prospective employees' POSDI, but may also boost OA and, ultimately, financial revenue.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1002/hrm.22242;Chasing two hares at once: The effects of goal orientation (in)congruence in teams. Organizations must excel at what they do well while also learning new ways of operating to achieve long-term success. Work teams may thus find themselves pursuing contradictory objectives to support the organization's strategy. We investigated teams' goal orientation (in)congruence and its impact on task meaningfulness and, ultimately, performance, hypothesizing the potential pitfalls of teams simultaneously pursuing both learning- and performance-goal orientations. Three-wave, multisource data were collected from 109 teams at a large North American mortgage company. In a polynomial regression and response surface analytical framework, team task meaningfulness-and subsequent team performance-was enhanced when teams had greater divergence between their learning- and performance-goal orientations but suffered when both goal orientations were more aligned. Our investigation thus revealed the potential pitfalls of teams simultaneously pursuing both learning- and performance-goal orientations. We discuss the theoretical contributions of the team goal orientation incongruence effect substantiated in this study, as well as implications for practice and future research.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22197;You make me anxious! Witnessing safety violations during the daily commute and at work leads to employee work withdrawal. Safety literature has traditionally focused on identifying and managing risk factors that lead to safety outcomes (e.g., injuries, accidents, death) at work. The current study takes a new perspective on employee safety and proposes that safety-related experience has more general work implications. Drawing on theories of stress coping and workplace anxiety, we test a mechanism on how employees' daily experiences of safety threats are related to their work behavior via negative emotional reactions. Specifically, we focus on employees' experiences of safety violations on the way to work and at work during the ongoing struggles with COVID-19.

10.1002/hrm.22158;The HR ecosystem: Emerging trends and a future research agenda. Human resource leaders are experimenting with new approaches to organizing and utilizing workers that are not limited to the traditional boundaries of the firm, but rather expand to an ecosystem of work and organization. This special issue introduction article introduces a set of papers from management scholars discussing the ecosystem of work and organization and offers a roadmap for future research on HR ecosystems. An ecosystem perspective invites us to rethink our current frameworks to better link theory to practice. It also challenges us to shift our level of analysis from the organization to the ecosystem, asking: how is work organized and conducted within this complex and evolving context? These papers uncover trends related to (1) technological mediation, (2) impermanence and adaptation, and (3) shared governance. Our hope is that by framing these trends found within the research in this special issue that scholars will be provided a better road map in moving forward with their own research on the role of HR within the ecosystem of work and organization.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22150;Exploring the socio-political dynamics of front-line managers' HR involvement: A qualitative approach. Moving beyond the extant HR implementation research that has often viewed the implementation decisions primarily as front-line managers' (FLMs) prerogative, this article explores interactive processes involving three key actors: HR managers, senior managers, and FLMs. Drawing on a political lens, the authors find that the way in which FLMs enact HR practices depends on the relative power of the enforcing actors (i.e., HR managers) and the endorsing actors (i.e., senior managers). The study findings reveal that while the enforcers employ a range of influence tactics (e.g., legitimization, pressure, rational persuasion, and consultation) to facilitate strict HR enactment, the endorsers use counter-influence tactics (e.g., legitimization, assertiveness, and inspirational appeal) in support of deviant HR implementation behaviors. Carefully navigating both sides' influence tactics in light of past involvement experiences, FLMs choose subsequent implementation behaviors accordingly. The paper makes a meaningful contribution to the HR devolution research by delving into relational power dynamics that develop over an early phase of HR implementation. The resulting theoretical framework provides novel insights into the reasons behind FLMs' divergent forms of implementation behaviors. It shows that the ongoing multi-lateral interactions and political maneuverings involving HR-related actors trigger distinct HR involvement patterns.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2023-0918;Understanding turnover of generation Y early-career workers: the influence of values and field of study. PurposeGeneration Y early-career workers have the highest turnover rates ever seen. To better understand this phenomenon, this study combines the P-O values fit with the Cohort perspectives to (1) identify the work-related values of this generation, (2) explore the relation between values and turnover intentions and examine how the field of study influences this relationship and (3) verify if the turnover intentions materialized one year after the first data collection.Design/methodology/approachWe interviewed 71 early-career workers and applied thematic analysis to identify the value categories. A classification decision tree tested whether the field of study influences the relation between values and turnover intentions. A post-test was conducted to determine whether the reported turnover intentions were materialized one year later.FindingsThematic analysis yielded 285 themes that were grouped into 12 values' categories. Decision trees revealed that the combination of values that most predicted turnover was substantially different between Finance graduates (more instrumental and future-oriented values) and Innovation and Entrepreneurship graduates (more social and job-oriented values). The post-test confirmed that the number of respondents who reported an intention to quit their jobs during the interview with us and did quit one year later was statistically significant.Originality/valueTo our knowledge, this is the first study that uses critical incident interviews to explore the work-related values of this specific cohort and their relation to turnover. Our findings on the moderating effects of the field of study are unprecedented. We also identified three new work-value categories, and, to our knowledge, this is the first study that used decision trees to explore the relation between values and turnover.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2023-0136;Innovation-enhancing HRM, employee promotive voice and perceived organizational performance: a multilevel moderated serial mediation analysis. PurposeIn a complex, ever-changing, and turbulent business world, encouraging employees to express their improvement-oriented novel ideas through voice behavior is crucial for organizations to survive and thrive. Understanding how to foster employee promotive voice at work is a significant issue for both researchers and managers. This study explores how to foster employee promotive voice through specific HRM practices and positive employee attitudes. It also examines the effect of employee promotive voice on perceived organizational performance.Design/methodology/approachThis study employed a time-lagged multisource survey design. Data were collected from 215 executives, 790 supervisors, and 1,004 employees in 113 firms, and analyzed utilizing a multilevel moderated serial mediation model.FindingsThe findings of this study revealed that promotive voice was significantly related to perceived organizational performance. Innovation-enhancing HRM was positively associated with employee promotive voice. The HRM-voice relationship was partially mediated by employee job satisfaction. Power distance orientation was found to significantly moderate the relationship between innovation-enhancing HRM and employee job satisfaction at the firm level. Our findings showed that innovation-enhancing HRM policies may fail to foster promotive voice if they do not enhance employee job satisfaction.Originality/valueThis study challenges some taken-for-granted assumptions in the literature such as any high performance HRM bundles (e.g. HPWS) can foster employee promotive voice, and the effects of HRM are direct and even unconditional on organizational outcomes. It emphasizes the need to avoid potential unintended effects of HRM on employee voice and the importance of contextualizing voice research.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

PurposeOrganisations are increasingly adopting and adapting to technological advancements to stay relevant in the era of intense competition. Simultaneously, employee mental well-being has become a prominent global concern affecting people across various demographics. With this in mind, the present study explores the influence of human resource (HR) analytics, mental health organisational evidence-based management (OEBM) and organisational mental health support on the mental well-being of employees. Additionally, the study examines the moderating effects of manager and peer support on the association between organisational mental health support and the mental well-being of employees.Design/methodology/approachData were collected from 418 employees in India and structural equation modelling was performed to analyse the data.FindingsThe study found significant positive associations between HR analytics with mental health OEBM, organisational mental health support and mental well-being. Mental health OEBM was also found to be positively related to organisational mental health support and mental well-being. The moderating roles of manager and team support were also found to be significant in the associations between organisational mental health support and well-being.Originality/valueThe study showed that HR analytics is a valuable source of mental health data. This data can facilitate the development of evidence-based management (EBM) strategies to promote the mental well-being of employees.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2023-0011;A diary study on location autonomy and employee mental distress: the mediating role of task-environment fit. PurposeThis study aims to examine the role of location autonomy (i.e. autonomy over where to work) in shaping employee mental distress during their working days.Design/methodology/approachA total of 316 employees from 6 organizations in the UK provided data for 4,082 half-day sessions, over 10 working days. Random intercept modeling is used to analyze half-day data nested within individuals.FindingsResults show that location autonomy, beyond decision-making autonomy and work-method autonomy, is positively associated with the perception of task-environment (TE) fit which, in turn, contributes to lower mental distress during each half-day session. Results of supplementary analysis also show that location autonomy can contribute to higher absorption, task proficiency and job satisfaction via TE fit during each half-day session.Originality/valueThis study reveals the importance and uniqueness of location autonomy in shaping employees' outcomes, offering implications for how organizations can use this in the work-life flexibility policies to support employee mental health.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

PurposeDrawing on social capital theory, this study investigated the effects of structural, cognitive and relational family social capital on employees' career advancement through the mechanism of family-to-work enrichment (FWE), taking perceived organizational politics (POP) as a moderator.Design/methodology/approachSurvey data were collected from 252 full-time employees working in public institutions and government departments in China, a collectivist cultural context. Hierarchical regression and path analysis were conducted to test the hypotheses.FindingsFWE significantly mediated the positive relationships between the three subtypes of family social capital and career advancement. The effects of structural and cognitive family social capital, but not relational family social capital (RFSC), on FWE were stronger when POP was low (vs high).Research limitations/implicationsFWE is arguably a promising mechanism for explaining the links between family social capital and career outcomes. However, due to the cross-sectional nature of the data, conclusions regarding causality remain limited.Practical implicationsFamily social capital may enrich the careers of employees in collectivist cultures. Managers should mitigate their organization's political climate to promote employees' career advancement.Originality/valueThis study contributes to career research by linking family social capital to career outcomes through the lens of FWE for the first time and by identifying organizational politics as an important moderator that can influence the dynamics of resource enrichment in a collectivist culture.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2021-0335;Employee idiosyncratic deals (i-deals) and organizational justice: the role of individual job performance and coworkers' i-deals. Purpose - Idiosyncratic deals (i-deals) have been shown to influence several employee outcomes positively. To extend the research, the authors examine the effect of i-deals on employees' perceptions of organizational justice, in particular, how the relationship between employees' own i-deals and organizational justice is affected by employees' job performance as well as their perceptions of coworkers' i-deals.Design/methodology/approach - The authors tested the theoretical model using survey data from 182 hotel employees.Findings - Results show that i-deals are positively related to employees' perceptions of organizational justice and that such effects are stronger among high performing employees. The effect of i-deals on organizational justice was also more pronounced among employees who viewed coworkers as having successfully negotiated i-deals.Practical implications - The authors' findings suggest that organizations can benefit from providing i-deals through employees' enhanced perceptions of organizational justice. The paper thus recommends that organizations understand the impact of providing more flexible human resources (HR) practices and customized work arrangements that are aligned with individual goals and needs. This may be particularly relevant to high performers. Furthermore, the findings suggest that organizations may want to make i-deals available to employees more widely than to just a few selected individuals.Originality/value - This study is one of a few attempts that empirically investigate the relationship between i-deals and organizational justice. The findings of this study shed light on the possibility that employees develop positive justice perceptions toward employees' organization based on the appreciation of the customized work arrangements granted to both themselves and others.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2021-0735;Is employer collection of diversity data attractive to potential job seekers? Ethnicity and sex differences and a UK-Sweden comparison. Purpose Many organisations monitor statistics on the background of job applicants to inform diversity management, a practice known as equality monitoring (EM). The study examines perceptions of EM and employers that use it. Additionally, it aims to assess potentially salient group differences in attitudes towards EM, focussing on perceived history of employment discrimination, ethnicity, sex, and a comparison between the UK and Sweden - two countries which differ extensively in EM prevalence. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional self-report survey assessed attitudes toward EM, attraction to employers using it, pro-equality and diversity attitudes, perceived history of employment discrimination and background characteristics (e.g. ethnicity and sex), and compared a UK and Sweden sample (N = 925). Findings The results reveal positive perceptions of EM overall. Although no differences were observed between UK ethnic majority and minority respondents, White British men rate employers using EM as less attractive with increasing levels of perceived past discrimination. Women have more positive perceptions than men. Finally, the UK sample rated EM more positively than the Sweden sample. Originality/value Despite EM being widespread, the study is the first to investigate detailed perceptions of it, making group and country comparisons. Results support the use of EM in HRM but highlight the need for clear communication to avoid confusion with positive discrimination, which is perceived negatively in some majority group members, and to allay fears of data misuse. Recommendations are made for future implementation.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Purpose With a focus on the evolution of human resource management (HRM) quantification over 2000-2020, this study addresses the following questions: (1) What are the data sources used to quantify HRM? (2) What are the methods used to quantify HRM? (3) What are the objectives of HRM quantification? (4) What are the representations of quantification in HRM? Design/methodology/approach This study is based on an integrative synthesis of 94 published peer-reviewed empirical and non-empirical articles on the use of quantification in HRM. It uses the theoretical framework of the sociology of quantification. Findings The analysis shows that there have been several changes in HRM quantification over 2000-2020 in terms of data sources, methods and objectives. Meanwhile, representations of quantification have evolved relatively little;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2020-0350;Entrepreneurial alertness and self-perceived employability: a virtuous marriage for career development. Purpose Building on the importance of students becoming entrepreneurs of their own career, this research aimed to achieve two main objectives: to empirically test the sequential relationship between the three dimensions of entrepreneurial alertness as proposed by Tang et al. (2012) and to link such dimensions to self-perceived employability. Design/methodology/approach A web survey data were obtained among a sample of 404 universities students. The test of the theoretical framework was performed by running a structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings The results show that the three entrepreneurial alertness components are sequentially related. Moreover, the results demonstrated that among the examined dimensions, only evaluation and judgment had a direct effect on self-perceived employability, with the remaining dimensions having an indirect influence. Originality/value There has been rarely any previous empirical attempt at investigating a framework that consider the relationship between entrepreneurial attitudes, such as alertness, on employability. The investigation of the entrepreneurial attitudes as antecedents of employability is particularly vital to graduates who will soon enter the labor market as entrepreneurs of their own career.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-07-2023-0562;Fighting fear: the buffering of well-being-HRM on the effects of nurses' fear of COVID-19 on job stress and patient care. PurposePre-pandemic research demonstrated the challenges of the nursing workforce and the provision of quality of patient care. Such challenges have been significantly intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic, not least in the workplace and fear of staff catching and transmitting COVID-19. We draw on conservation of resources (COR) theory to examine the impact of the fear of COVID-19 on nurses and the role of well-being-HRM (WBHRM) in negating the fear of COVID-19 and its impact on job stress and perceived quality of patient care.Design/methodology/approachWe collected data from 260 nurses (treating COVID-19 patients) employed in US hospitals across two-waves. Data were analyzed using mediated regression and moderated mediation.FindingsThe results indicated that when nurses report higher levels of fear of COVID-19, this translates into higher levels of nursing job stress. This, in turn, reduces nurses' perceptions of quality of patient care they can provide. As previous research has found, decreased perceptions of quality of patient care is a significant factor driving intentions to leave the profession. The results demonstrated that WBHRM practices buffer the negative impact of fear of COVID-19 on job stress, and in turn, the perceived quality of patient care.Originality/valueOur paper contributes to new knowledge for healthcare managers on WBHRM bundles and their efficacy in buffering the effects of fear on job stress and quality of patient care. We contribute new knowledge on fear at work and how to manage employees' fear through WBHRM practices.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-09-2022-0645;Experience layoffs, work engagement and the buffering effect of POS: a psychological contract perspective. PurposeThis study aims to explore the relationship between experience layoffs and employees' work engagement. Drawing on the psychological contract theory, we examine the parallel mediating role of cognitive and affective job insecurity, along with the moderating role of perceived organisational support.Design/methodology/approachThe hypotheses were tested based on data collected from 737 employees of companies in various industries in China in an online survey.FindingsThe results showed the significant effect of experiencing layoffs on employees' work engagement through cognitive and affective job insecurity, and the effect was stronger when perceived organisational support was lower. The moderated mediation effect mainly occurred through affective job insecurity but not cognitive job insecurity.Originality/valueThis study deepens the understanding of the mechanism of the negative effect of experiencing layoffs and the boundaries of its impact from a psychological contract breach perspective. By analysing the mediating role of cognitive and affective job insecurity, we have enhanced our understanding of the exchange-based mechanism of employees after experiencing layoffs. By examining the moderating role of perceived organisational support, we reveal the important role of supportive behaviours of organisations in mitigating the negative effects of experiencing layoffs.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-11-2021-0826;Double-edged sword at work: impacts of guanxi human resource management on employee innovative behavior. PurposeThis paper develops and tests a theoretical framework to explain the effect of guanxi human resource management (HRM), a unique Chinese cultural phenomenon, on employee innovative behavior.Design/methodology/approachWe draw from a sample of 398 employees in 81 teams and test the moderated mediation model using multi-level modeling.FindingsThe results show that guanxi HRM can be perceived by employees as being simultaneously an unethical hindrance that stifles innovative behavior and a strategic challenge that is beneficial for innovative behavior. In addition, the results show that these indirect effects are contingent upon the strength of guanxi HRM.Originality/valueThe study advances our understanding of the mechanism and boundary condition underlying the double-edged nature of guanxi HRM practices.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2023-0377;Extending the research frontiers of employee mental health through contextualisation: China as an example with implications for human resource management research and practice. PurposeImpoverished employee mental health is harmful to employees and organisational performance. There is emerging interest in employee mental health in the human resource management (HRM) field. The majority of these studies mainly focus on the organisational and individual levels from the psychological and managerial perspectives without considering the sectoral characteristics and societal context.Design/methodology/approachThis perspective paper draws on extant literature as well as 10 informal interviews with medical professionals, organisational leaders in the public sector, teachers and HR professionals to shed light on employee mental health research, practice and challenges in the Chinese context.FindingsThis paper reveals national, sectoral, occupational and individual factors that shape mental health problems, individual coping mechanisms and organisational interventions. It also shows international influence on employee mental health in the form of institutional pressure and knowledge transfer.Research limitations/implicationsThere is limited research on employee mental health and HRM in the Chinese context, which restricts the scope of discussion in this paper, but at the same time presents rich future research opportunities that may be relevant to other national settings.Practical implicationsManaging the mental health of the workforce is part of the mental health management of the population, which means a holistic approach to building a mental health eco-system needs to be adopted. The authors call for more research on employee mental health in the Chinese context to provide evidence to support policy development and organisational efforts to scale up mental health services at the national and organisational levels. The authors also provide practical recommendations for policymakers and employing organisations.Originality/valueThe authors present a multi-level and multi-factor overview related to employee mental health in the Chinese context. The authors argue for a resource-based and multi-stakeholder approach, which will help inform and improve mental health policy and practice. The authors present several avenues for future scholarship and research. The authors extend the research frontiers of employee mental health issues by calling for the inclusion of a broader range of theoretical lenses including institutional theory, cultural and spiritual perspective and critical sociology to understand more fully how employee mental health conditions may be undermined or improved.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-07-2020-0558;Self-determined motivation, cross-cultural adjustment and organizational commitment: a study of foreign low-skilled workers in a developed economy. Purpose This study aims to investigate the relationship between self-determined motivation and organizational commitment, with the mediating role of cross-cultural adjustment of low-skilled workers who come from an emerging economy working in a developed economy. This study also aims to determine the interaction effect between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation on organizational commitment. Design/methodology/approach This study collects a sample data of 236 Vietnamese laborers in Taiwan. Structural equation modeling is used to analyze data and test hypotheses. Findings Results show that intrinsic and extrinsic motivations are positively related to organizational commitment. Cross-cultural adjustment positively mediates the relationship between intrinsic motivation and organizational commitment and that between extrinsic motivation and organizational commitment. Furthermore, extrinsic motivation positively moderates the relationship between intrinsic motivation and organizational commitment. Originality/value This study helps to untangle the relationship between self-determined motivation and organizational commitment of low-skilled workers in an unfamiliar environment. Furthermore, this study also clarifies the mediating and moderating mechanisms of cross-cultural adjustment and extrinsic motivation in this relationship. The findings provide implications for researchers and managers to plan and implement policy and management systems that combine tangible and intangible incentives to motivate foreign workers and induce positive outcomes for companies in a new cultural context.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-11-2021-0785;Catching emotions: the moderating role of emotional contagion between leader-member exchange, psychological capital and employee well-being. Purpose This paper uses conservation of resources theory to compare the impact of supervisor-employee relationships and the extent to which emotional contagion (EC) moderates the links between psychological capital (PsyCap) and well-being for United States (US) healthcare workers. Design/methodology/approach In this study structural equation modeling (SEM) and analysis of variances (ANOVAs) were used to test survey data collected at two points in time from 240 US doctors, nurses and allied health professionals. Findings The findings provide insight into why healthcare professionals, who undertake emotional labor, have a higher incidence of lower well-being and increased burnout rates compared with other jobs, except for emergency workers. The findings show that the relationship between PsyCap and well-being was different for low and high EC employees. The impact of PsyCap on well-being was greater for those with lower EC, and this means that those employees who have high EC have a greater risk of reduced well-being. Originality/value Traditional bureaucratic rationalist management models are inappropriate for managing those who have high EC and/or undertake emotional labor. Instead, new human resource (HR) models are needed that focus on employee well-being, and in providing greater organizational support and upskilling employees in how to cope with their emotions and to build their own reservoirs of personal support.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2021-0320;The influences of cross-cultural adjustment and motivation on self-initiated expatriates' innovative work behavior. Purpose - Drawing upon the cross-cultural adjustment (CCA) model and self-determination theory, this study investigated the influence of CCA (work, interactional, and general adjustment) and motivation (autonomous and controlled) on the innovative work behavior of self-initiated expatriates (SIEs).Design/methodology/approach - Multi-source data were collected from 213 SIEs and their supervisors working in the United Arab Emirates to provide an understanding of the role of SIEs' CCA and motivation and their innovative work behavior.Findings - Findings indicated that work, interactional, and general adjustment are positively related to innovative work behavior. Autonomous motivation positively predicts innovative work behavior, while controlled motivation does not. Additionally, autonomous motivation moderated the effects of work adjustment and interactional adjustment on SIEs' innovative work behavior, whereas controlled motivation moderates the effect of general adjustment on SIEs' innovative work behavior.Originality/value - SIEs are regarded as talents that have the skills and valuable knowledge gained from their international experience and can be utilized in organizations to perform innovative work behaviors. However, SIEs face adjustment challenges that may hinder their ability to be innovative. Despite their potential as innovation drivers in organizations, there are few studies on the factors that affect SIEs' innovative behavior. This study contributes to the literature by examining the effects of adjustment and motivation on SIEs' innovative work behavior.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-03-2021-0172;Attraction and retention of employees in an Australian regional SME: the importance of place and scale in human resource management. Purpose This study examines employee attraction and retention issues and uses a case study of an Australian regional medium-sized enterprise to highlight the importance of organisational context factors such as place and scale in designing human resource (HR) solutions. Design/methodology/approach The research presents a qualitative case study, with data drawn from strategic documents, interviews and focus groups, analysed thematically. Findings A carefully constructed set of HR strategies - including purposeful use of employer branding, synchronising of human resource management (HRM) formality and informality and capitalising on the regional context - are key to employee attraction and retention and in turn the growth and competitiveness of the case study organisation. Originality/value The HRM literature acknowledges the tendency to study larger corporations in metropolitan areas, at the expense of more nuanced research related to context. This research contributes to knowledge of attraction and retention through employer branding, with particular attention to scale and place, through study of a medium sized firm in a regional location. It highlights the importance of informality-formality dynamism.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2021-0305;Modelling the interaction between serious leisure, self-perceived employability, stress, and workplace well-being: empirical insights from graduates in India. Purpose Drawing on a framework of Job Demands-Resources (JD-R), the purpose of this paper is to conceptually develop and empirically validate a moderated mediation model of serious leisure and workplace well-being. Design/methodology/approach The data were collected between December 2020 and March 2021 using an online questionnaire. A total of 225 completed questionnaires were received from employees in India who graduated between 2018 and 2020. Findings The authors' findings indicate that serious leisure is positively associated with workplace well-being and that the relationship is mediated by self-perceived employability. Stress moderates the relationship between serious leisure and self-perceived employability in such a way that the association is stronger when levels of stress are higher. Stress also moderates the mediating effect of self-perceived employability on the relationship between serious leisure and workplace well-being such that the indirect effect of serious leisure on workplace well-being is stronger when levels of stress are higher. Originality/value Theoretical implications come from drawing on leisure studies literature to differentiate casual leisure and serious leisure. The concept of serious leisure is subsequently integrated into the human resource management literature to explore the relationship between serious leisure, self-perceived employability, stress, and workplace well-being. Practical and policy implications suggest how universities and organisations can support their students and early careers talent by encouraging them to participate in serious leisure activities.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-03-2020-0133;Job autonomy and knowledge hiding: the moderating roles of leader reward omission and person-supervisor fit. Purpose In this paper, the moderating roles of leader reward omission and person-supervisor fit in the relationship between job autonomy and knowledge hiding are investigated. Design/methodology/approach Using a sample of 248 employees in a two-wave survey, we performed a hierarchical regression analysis to test the hypotheses. Findings The results revealed that employees with high job autonomy were less likely to engage in knowledge hiding. Moreover, when employees experienced leader reward omission, the negative relationship between job autonomy and knowledge hiding was weakened, and this interesting effect varied by person-supervisor fit. Research limitations/implications This study does not explore the mediating mechanism by which job autonomy affects employee knowledge hiding. Moreover, as this research was conducted in a Chinese context, the generalizability of our findings is unclear. Practical implications This research has fulfilled its practical aims by providing advice on knowledge-relevant job characteristic factors that can be used to stage interventions regarding the provision of autonomy in jobs, and by carefully considering how to create interdependence between jobs without pushing people to engage in knowledge-hiding behaviors. Furthermore, it is important for leaders to help employees identify work goals and directions and not engage in reward omission. Originality/value This study contributes to theoretical advancements in the field of knowledge hiding by revealing boundary conditions that mitigate or enhance the impact of job autonomy on knowledge hiding.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-11-2019-0605;Perceived HRM practices and organizational citizenship behaviours: a case study of a Chinese high-tech organization. Purpose The purpose of this case study is to test a moderated mediation model linking employees' perceived HRM practices to organizational citizenship behaviours (OCB) with perceived insider status as the mediator and emotional exhaustion as the moderator in a Chinese high-tech organization. Design/methodology/approach A sample of 417 Chinese employees were recruited from a large Chinese high-tech company to participate in a paper-and-pencil survey, and mediation and moderation were analysed using PROCESS macro for SPSS. Findings Perceived insider status partially mediates the relationship between perceived HRM practices and OCB, and emotional exhaustion moderates the relationship between perceived insider status and OCB such that the strength of the relationship is stronger in employees with low emotional exhaustion levels than in employees with high emotional exhaustion levels. Practical implications There is a need for organizations to promote the physical and psychological well-being of its employees in order to maximize the effectiveness of HRM practices. Originality/value This case study provides novel insights into how employees' perceived HRM practices elicit OCB and its boundary conditions in collectivistic cultures.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-09-2020-0670;A sustainable career for interim managers: the role of career communities. Purpose This study examines how the collective construction of career sustainability takes place through a career community of interim managers. Design/methodology/approach We draw on 31 interviews with interim managers who are part of a career community in the form of a professional association of interim managers in France. Findings The findings show the importance of career communities as a vehicle through which to create a sustainable career. More specifically, we show that occupational career communities provide mutual and reciprocal career support, collective being and belonging through sense-making as well as collective learning leading to the collective creation of a sustainable career. Originality/value We add to the literature on sustainable careers by providing a collective community-level analysis and make a theoretical contribution by using the concept of career communities in shedding light on the career sustainability of interim managers. In the light of the increase in non-standard forms of employment, career communities might become an interesting vehicle for career management and development.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-07-2020-0563;Freelance job search during times of uncertainty: protean career orientation, career competencies and job search. Purpose Freelancers are a growing population of working adults with limited to no organizational support. Yet, their strategies to navigate job search, especially in turbulent times, are unknown. To address this gap, the author hypothesized and examined a sequential mediation model whereby freelancer protean career orientation (PCO) influences job search strategies through career competencies (i.e. knowing why, how and with whom to work) and job search self-efficacy (JSSE). Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from a sample of 87 Canadian freelancers during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings The results supported the sequential mediation from PCO to job search strategies through two of the career competencies (knowing why and how) and JSSE. The mediating role of knowing whom was not supported. Practical implications Policy makers and learning institutions can provide freelancers with opportunities to develop transferable skills through massive open online courses (MOOCs). Employers of freelancers can design motivating jobs that provide freelancers with on-the-job learning and development opportunities. Social implications The insignificant mediating role of knowing whom (i.e. professional networks) implies that large networks might not be necessarily beneficial in times of crisis. Thus, the role of networks might be more complex than the literature has proposed. Originality/value This study brings into focus an overlooked population of workers: freelancers. It investigates a sequential mediation through which freelancer PCO impacts job search strategies. In addition, it compares the effectiveness of career competencies in unfolding the proposed sequential mediation.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2020-0469;Perceived organizational injustice and counterproductive work behaviours: mediated by organizational identification, moderated by discretionary human resource practices. Purpose This research unpacks the relationship between employees' perceptions of organizational injustice and their counterproductive work behaviour, by detailing a mediating role of organizational identification and a moderating role of discretionary human resource (HR) practices. Design/methodology/approach The hypotheses were tested with a sample of employees in Pakistan, collected over three, time-lagged waves. Findings An important reason that beliefs about unfair organizational treatment lead to enhanced counterproductive work behaviour is that employees identify less strongly with their employing organization. This mediating role of organizational identification is less salient, however, to the extent that employees can draw from high-quality, discretionary HR practices that promote their professional development and growth. Practical implications For management practitioners, this study pinpoints a key mechanism - the extent to which employees personally identify with their employer - by which beliefs about organizational favouritism can escalate into purposeful efforts to inflict harm on the organization and its members. It also reveals how this risk can be subdued by discretionary practices that actively support employees' careers. Originality/value This study adds to previous research by detailing why and when employees' frustrations about favouritism-based organizational decision making may backfire and elicit deviant responses that likely compromise their own organizational standing.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-11-2023-0934;Competitive strategy delivery in the service sector: a study of the behavioural model. PurposeOne of the most cited literature in SHRM is Schuler and Jackson's (1987) behavioural model. This model proposes that organisational performance is dependent on the extent to which HRM practices can be effectively connected to competitive strategy and desired employee behaviours. Importantly, this model recognises the salient role of employee behaviour in performance outcomes and, moreover that different competitive strategies imply both promulgation and reinforcement of different sets of employee skills and behaviours. Surprisingly, despite its significant influence on SHRM, studies rarely examine this model in its entirety. Motivated by the need to better understand this model's arguments in contemporary settings, our study uses a multi-actor design to explore the connections between competitive strategies (cost reduction and differentiation), employee behaviours, and HRM practices in service environments.Design/methodology/approachAdopting a multi-level, multi-actor survey design, our exploratory deductive study assesses the utility of strategic HRM's (SHRM) behavioural model. Drawing on data from a sample of service organisations and using univariate analyses, we compare operationalised HRM practices and employee behaviours across different strategy types.FindingsResults lend provisional support for the behavioural model, particularly in the case of a differentiation strategy where notable differences in HRM practices and employee behaviours were observed. Findings suggest growing levels of memetic and competitive isomorphism may be occurring, with this likely attributable to the increased incidence of idea generation and information sharing about best practices occurring amongst practitioners, as well as a growing nuance in operating markets, managerial preferences, employee expectations, stakeholder objectives, and the like.Research limitations/implicationsOur study suggests refinements to the behavioural model are needed. Some support for the model's key tenets is found, but these appear context specific. Thus, the merit in developing a priori typologies linking strategy type to HRM practices and employee behaviours where organisations operate in environments which are particularised and tumultuous appears debatable.Practical implicationsThis study highlights the behavioural model's nuance to modern service organisations and, by doing so, practitioners are provided with a behavioural pathway for achieving competitive advantage through their HRM practices. Findings also suggest that increasingly competitive environments might be encouraging practitioners to engage in isomorphic behaviours.Originality/valueThe use of a comparative research design allowed our study to contribute much needed empiricism to the largely conceptually informed stylised typologies depicting the linkages between different competitive strategies, implied employee role behaviours and HRM practices, thereby supporting the need for model refinement.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2022-0279;How are frontline managers supported in the performance management process?. Purpose Existing research has ignored the perspectives of frontline managers (FLMs) in relation to the support they receive. This study aims to understand the extent to which and how other organisational actors support FLMs in their implementation of performance.Design/methodology/approach This article used a qualitative method (57 semi-structured interviews) in two Singapore public sector organisations to understand the types of support provided to FLMs. The interviewees came from various levels and the hierarchical sampling frame allowed for comparisons to be made across the cases.Findings The authors found that the HR department, superiors and peers signalled to FLMs the custom and practice of performance management (PM) that led to the FLMs not prioritising their PM responsibilities. Notably, the focus of the FLMs was on meeting operational needs rather than the PM process.Originality/value The authors add to the literature by examining the how the support from other organisational actors signalled to FLMs the importance of PM within their work group. This paper also explores how FLMs seek support and the type of support they want in their role.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2023-0399;Adoption of competence management practices by industries in an emerging country: an analysis via fuzzy TOPSIS. PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to examine competence management practices in Brazilian industries using ISO 10015 as a framework of analysis, which establishes guidelines for competence management and people development.Design/methodology/approachA survey was conducted with 22 high-qualified human resources management (HRM) professionals (81.8% of participants hold a PhD) with extensive experience in the Brazilian industrial sector (an average of 20.4 years). The experts assessed 13 practices (P) elaborated based on the ISO 10015:2020, considering two categories: large industries (LI) and small and medium-sized industries (SMI). Data analysis was performed using Hierarchical Cluster Analysis, frequency analysis, Fuzzy TOPSIS and sensitivity analysis.FindingsThe practice individual competences are correctly defined by organizations at all hierarchical levels was deemed the best practice for LIs, while the practice clear definition of activities and their specificities when structuring competence management and people development programs was considered the best practice for SMIs. The practice organizations map employees' future competence and development needs on a regular basis received the lowest rating for both LIs and SMIs. When compared to LIs, SMIs have more severe deficiencies in applying competence management practices. The study's findings can be of great value in assisting managers in implementing structured competence management systems and people development initiatives.Practical implicationsThe findings of this study can be used by managers of businesses of all sizes and economic sectors to analyze their critical points in order to identify opportunities to improve their competence management systems and people development programs.Originality/valueThis study fills a knowledge gap by analyzing the adoption of competence management practices in Brazil, answering the call for HRM research in developing countries. By using ISO 10015 as a framework of analysis, this study also addresses the literature gap regarding this important and relatively new management tool.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2022-0456;Who is worthy of my commitment now? The dynamic nature of interns' workplace commitment. PurposeThe paper aims to investigate the dynamics of individuals' multiple commitments in the internship context by answering two questions: How do interns' commitment to different stakeholders change over time? And what are the reasons behind these changes?Design/methodology/approachA qualitative longitudinal study was conducted of a hundred and three interviews with twenty interns in three professional service firms in the UK. The data were gathered via semi-structured interviews that took place on five occasions during the whole internship.FindingsIndividuals' decision to maintain or change their commitment depended on their motive to gain long-term benefits (future employment) or short-term benefits (completing an assignment). Therefore, they experienced different types of commitment dynamics, which were influenced by their intention to commit to the organization in the future.Practical implicationsThis offers significant implications for attracting and employing interns, which directly affects talent employment. It also contributes to the contemporary work context, as the rise of temporary and cross-boundary settings would increase the complexity and dynamics of commitment.Originality/valueDespite the predominant assumption that considers commitment as a stable bond, this research is one of the first to investigate the dynamics of multiple commitments. This contributes to the commitment theory by identifying the different types of commitment dynamics and the impact of individuals' intention to commit on the (in)stability of their commitment, which is absent from the existing literature.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-07-2022-0491;From corporate social responsibility (CSR) to corporate humanistic responsibility (CHR): the conceptualization and operationalization of perceived CHR. PurposeOrganizations that prioritize humanistic responsibility create an environment of value for their employees as the most important stakeholders. However, despite the numerous corporate social responsibility (CSR) models and research highlighting stakeholder considerations, the long-standing social aspect of CSR has inhibited its humanism responsibility. In response, this study proposes to move beyond the antecedents and outcomes of CSR to explore how perceived CSR can promote its humanistic responsibility both inside and outside of organizations.Design/methodology/approachThe authors followed Sendjaya et al. (2008) 's methodology for developing and validating the perceived corporate humanistic responsibility (CHR) scale. Study 1 validated the CHR's content. Study 2 established the measure' reliability, internal consistency, unidimensionality and discriminant validity. The authors describe each of the studies in the forthcoming sections.FindingsThis research has produced a comprehensive set of perceived CHR items for business leaders based on earlier CHR/humanism concepts. Through the deconstruction of CHR theory, the granular conceptualization provides employee-centric workplaces, healthy internal communication, holistic compensation, CSR-committed behaviors and holistic training and development, equipped to assess how their CHR fosters humanistic workplaces that encourage socially responsible behaviors. This, in turn, would have an immense impact on employee well-being that, in turn, flourishes societal well-being.Research limitations/implicationsAlthough the perceived CHR scale's psychometric properties were confirmed using multiple tests ranging from qualitative to quantitative studies, this newly developed scale requires further investigation to explore whether internal or external relevance factors affect organizations' humanistic responsibility.Practical implicationsCSR is about caring for humans and the planet. The authors have unpacked what and how the human side of CSR operates for business leaders to advance their CHR practices and responsible management learning. The perceived CHR dimensions can guide business leaders to promote multidimensional humanistic behaviors inside and outside workplaces that transcend how to strengthen the humanistic responsibility behaviors of corporations to promote CHR by articulating how the Social aspect of CSR ought to function for employee well-being first.Social implicationsThis study responds to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) most aligned with the SDG 3 (good health and well-being) and SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) by promoting humanistic workplaces with implications for United Nation's Principles for Responsible Management that encourages universities to educate students on humanism concepts in business management.Originality/valueThe originality lies in the empirical study of CHR. By incorporating the original concepts of humanism/humanistic management and CHR, the authors empirically articulate how CHR may be practically implemented as an elaborated humanistic synthesis for corporations.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1108/PR-01-2021-0037;Perceptions of living wage impacts in Aotearoa New Zealand: towards a multi-level, contextualised conceptualisation. Purpose The study maps workplace stakeholders' perceptions of living wage (LW) impacts in New Zealand. Empirical findings inform an inaugural model of LW impacts and contingent factors at individual, organisation, sector/industry and national levels. Design/methodology/approach Data from a national employee survey, semi-structured interviews with business sector representatives, and staff in two LW organisation cases were subjected to thematic content analysis. Findings Informants emphasised anticipated LW impacts amid complex workplace and regulatory dynamics. Employers/managers stressed its cost effects. However, employees, human resource (HR) advocates and other LW proponents highlighted employee investment impacts that improve worker productivity and societal circumstances. Research limitations/implications This study highlights the need for further context-sensitive LW analysis. An initial model of LW impacts provides a framework for comparative and longitudinal work in other national contexts. Practical implications The proposed model categorises perceived LW effects and can inform policy development. Findings also stress a need for cross-agency initiatives to address LW concerns, including a key role for HR. Social implications The findings highlight perceptions of a LW impacting within and beyond the workplace. Whilst higher-quality management is seen to encourage better-informed decisions about going living wage, a LW's positive socio-economic impacts require multi-lateral initiatives, suggesting that those initiatives are is part of wider obligations for policy makers to encourage decent living standards. Originality/value This study provides a much-needed and inaugural focus on the intertwined workplace and wider impacts of a LW, extending extant econometric analyses. The paper also synthesizes different data sources to develop an inaugural, context-sensitive model of perceived LW effects.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1108/PR-04-2020-0272;Continuous learning and employee performance: a moderated examination of managers' coaching behavior in India. Purpose By integrating organizational support theory (OST) and social cognitive theory, this study investigates types of managers' coaching behavior as experienced by the employees. Furthermore, the study examines whether employees would exhibit greater task and contextual performance when organizational learning is blended with a specific coaching behavior of their manager. Design/methodology/approach Using primary data from 298 software engineers working in select information technology companies across India, the current study attempts to assess moderating effect of managers' coaching behavior in two relationships, including continuous learning and employees' task performance (CL-TP) and continuous learning and employees' contextual performance (CL-CP). Findings Result of exploratory factor analysis suggests that managers of select organizations exhibit two major types of coaching behavior: inspiration-based coaching behavior and facilitation-based coaching behavior. On the moderating role of coaching behavior, it is documented that facilitation-based coaching behavior significantly positively moderates both stated (CL-TP and CL-CP) relationships, whereas inspiration-based coaching behavior of supervisors has positive significant effect on CL-TP relationship but negatively moderates the CL-CP relationship. Research limitations/implications The extent to which the findings of this study can be generalized is constrained by the limited sample and organizational context. Practical implications The most important managerial implication for all learning organizations is that both kinds of coaching behaviors help improving the task performance of the employees, but managers should prefer facilitation-based coaching style in order to generate higher contextual performance of employees. Originality/value This study contributes to practitioners and existing literature by explaining how individual performance of employees is affected by the investment made by organizations in facilitating continuous learning.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-11-2020-0844;Linking proactivity to work-family enrichment: a moderated mediation model. Purpose The purpose of this research is to explore the effect of proactivity on work-family enrichment through thriving at work and the moderation of such mediation by immediate supervisor perspective-taking. Design/methodology/approach Research data consisting of two-wave lagged data (N = 470) were collected from 470 employees of 17 domestic Chinese firms to examine the proposed moderated mediation model. Findings The findings show that proactivity was positively related to work-family enrichment and that thriving at work partially mediated this relationship. Immediate supervisor perspective-taking strengthens the effect of proactivity on thriving at work, and a positive indirect relationship exists between proactivity and work-family enrichment through thriving at work when immediate supervisor perspective-taking is high. Practical implications Organizations should formulate policies to motivate employees to engage in proactive behavior and stimulate employees' thriving at work. Organizations should also select leaders who are good at perspective-taking and provide training to leaders to help them take others' perspectives. Originality/value These results deepen our theoretical understanding of the consequences of proactivity by demonstrating the positive associations between proactive behavior and work-family enrichment. The current study also contributes to the literature by identifying the mediating mechanism of thriving at work to explain the relationship between proactivity and work-family enrichment. Furthermore, the results show that supervisor perspective-taking moderates the above mediation.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2020-0083;Understanding inclusion in the retail industry: incorporating the majority perspective. Purpose The aim of this paper is to move away from the focus upon the drivers of diversity to consider the drivers of inclusion in the workplace. The research outlined addresses this by considering the views of all employees, not just those who would be considered members of minority groups. Design/methodology/approach The paper draws on an extensive set of case study data from a range of methodological sources. The case study is of a major high street retailer. Findings Findings focus upon what leads to employees feeling included in the workplace. In addressing this we explore both the drivers of, and barriers to, inclusion. We argue that inclusion is complex and that individuals may feel included by some aspects of organisational culture whilst simultaneously feeling excluded by others. Practical implications The implications of our results for HR practitioners are that organisations need to pay attention to general HR policies as ways of enhancing inclusion, for example development practices, but also pay attention to the different needs of diverse groups. Originality/value The paper is original in that in recognising that equality, diversity and inclusion are all closely related, we demonstrate that an understanding of the effectiveness of diversity strategies needs to be fundamentally informed by a consideration of inclusion which can only occur through an engagement with employee's understandings of organisational culture and their place or otherwise within it. Without this employee engagement, many well-intentioned diversity initiatives may go awry. Moreover, the value of the research is that it demonstrates that in order to be successful an inclusion strategy needs to embrace both minority and majority perspectives.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22218;Managerial control or feedback provision: How perceptions of algorithmic HR systems shape employee motivation, behavior, and well-being.

10.1002/hrm.22131;A social network perspective on workplace inclusion: The role of network closure, network centrality, and need for affiliation. Organizations are increasingly recognizing the important role employee inclusion perceptions play in promoting positive employee attitudes and behaviors. Although social networks are frequently cited as being a driver of perceived inclusion, little empirical work has examined the social network conditions that give rise to it. We address this gap by examining how both network position (indegree centrality) and network structure (network closure) relate to perceived workplace inclusion. We test our hypotheses with a sample of 364 professionals in a multinational pharmaceutical firm. We find that both indegree centrality and network closure are positively related to perceived workplace inclusion. The relationship between network centrality and perceived workplace inclusion is strengthened by a high level of network closure. In addition, the relationship between network closure and perceived workplace inclusion is strengthened by a high level of need for affiliation. Our results, therefore, suggest that both network centrality and closure play an important role in employee perceptions of inclusion and demonstrate the importance of considering need for affiliation as a boundary condition. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for theory and practice.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22089;Recruitment brand equity for unknown employers: Examining the effects of recruitment message claim verifiability and credibility on job pursuit intentions. Prior research on recruitment and employer brand equity has primarily drawn on the cognitive psychology perspective from the marketing brand equity literature to examine how recruitment practices and job seekers' perceptions of employer brand image impact recruitment outcomes. This perspective, however, provides little guidance for how unknown organizations can use recruitment messages to influence job seekers. Our study draws from research on the search-experience framework, which uses an information economics approach to brand equity, to identify how recruitment claims from companies with no employer brand image shape job seekers' job pursuit intentions. Results based on a within-subjects study with 197 participants showed that job seekers perceive differences in claim verifiability depending on the job or company attribute in the message. Further, we found that job seekers' perceptions of recruitment claim verifiability are indirectly related to intentions to pursue the recruiting organization through perceived claim credibility. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22087;Unraveling the relationship between high-performance work systems and firm performance: A mediation analysis. Drawing upon the resource-based view and economic cost perspective, we examined the effect of firms' use of high-performance work systems (HPWS) on two firm performance outcomes-firm financial performance (FFP) and firm innovation and improvement (FII), indirectly through firm capacity for learning and transforming external knowledge and technologies (CLT). Our results confirmed that HPWS positively related to both FFP and FII through firm CLT. HPWS was found to have a linear association with CLT but an inverted U-shape relationship with FFP. We also revealed a three-factor structure of firm HPWS: motivation to perform, skills to enhance, and opportunity to engage. The supplementary analysis demonstrated a lack of significant three-way interaction between these three HPWS factors. Implications and future research directions are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22245;Crystal clear: How leaders and coworkers together shape role clarity and well-being for employees in social care. Working in social care is fraught with challenges fueled by changing policies, funding structures, societal expectations, and high relational demands, leaving employees in this sector particularly vulnerable to poor well-being. In this study, we focus on the importance of a supportive work context-specifically coworker instrumental support and leaders' role clarity-in enabling employee role clarity, and how this can foster better mental health and reduce fatigue from ongoing changes in the sector. We ran a multilevel moderated mediation model on a sample of 270 social care employees matched with 47 leaders across two disability care organizations in Australia. Results showed that coworker instrumental support promotes role clarity, which in turn is associated with lower psychological distress and change fatigue, and higher job satisfaction. The positive relationship between coworker instrumental support and role clarity, and the subsequent relationships with well-being, were stronger when employees had leaders who themselves had role clarity. Our findings highlight the importance of a supportive work context and role clarity as malleable levers in enabling a sustainable social care workforce and provide new theoretical and practical insights for human resource management in the social care sector.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22246;Commitment capital: Bridging the gap between organizational commitment and human capital resources. Even though, the human resource management literature has highlighted the importance of having employees that are committed to the organization, research on strategic human capital has yet to fully consider how commitment is related to human capital resources. In order to overcome the dominant individual-level conceptualization of commitment and to detail how commitment affects human capital resources, we develop the unit-level concept of commitment capital, which we divide into three levels: affiliative commitment capital, affinitive commitment capital, and absolute commitment capital. These conceptualizations are based on a 10-year case study and incorporate commitment into a strategic human capital framework, thus bridging the current gap between organizational commitment and human capital resources.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22240;Identifying forms of after-hours information communication technology use and their role in psychological detachment: An episodic approach. Employees increasingly conduct work outside of traditional work hours via information communication technologies (ICTs). There is a need to understand how after-hours ICT use relates to well-being, given that such connectivity has become unavoidable. We implement an episodic, event-contingent design to evaluate the association between different ICT media (i.e., e-mail, phone call, chat app, short message service) and the within-person outcomes of psychological detachment as partially mediated by task productivity. A daily diary survey was collected over three consecutive workdays to capture after-hours ICT use. Daily surveys were completed by 498 individuals, with a total of 1494 episodes being captured of after-hours work ICT engagement. Our results indicate that while engagement with any form of ICT after hours reduces psychological detachment, email and chat apps are associated with the lowest levels of psychological detachment. Moreover, whereas the use of asynchronous ICT has positive main effects on episode-related task productivity, the use of synchronous ICT (e.g., phone) only enhances episode-related task productivity when there are high organizational expectations for employees' responsiveness after hours.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22221;Perceived overqualification and employee outcomes: The dual pathways and the moderating effects of dual-focused transformational leadership. Research findings concerning the effects of perceived overqualification on task performance are mixed. To reconcile the disparate findings, drawing on person-environment theory, we propose cynicism toward the job and constructive deviance as contrasting dual pathways that explain the negative and positive effects of perceived overqualification on task performance and employee creativity. We also examine the moderating effects of dual-focused transformational leadership (TFL) on the relationships between perceived overqualification and the two mediating mechanisms. We test this model using data collected from 469 employees and their 135 supervisors via two-wave surveys. The results support the negative and positive mediating mechanisms. In addition, based on one field study and two online experiments, we find that individual-focused TFL mitigates the relationship between perceived overqualification and cynicism toward the job, but that team-focused TFL enhances the relationship between perceived overqualification and constructive deviance.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22212;The moderating role of social capital for late-career management intervention effects on older employees' work engagement. Despite increasing interest in supporting older workers' motivation, retention, and well-being at work, knowledge about how social networks at work may affect the efficacy of training interventions among older employees is scarce. These social ties are an important source of resources for older workers' careers. This study examined the characteristics of older workers' personal social networks as boundary conditions for the effects of late-career management intervention on work engagement. Data were used from an earlier randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which senior employees (mean age of 58 years) participated in a peer group-based training intervention and were asked to complete follow-up surveys at baseline, post-intervention, and after 6 months (Vuori et al., 2019, Journal of Vocational Behavior, 115: 103327). The results showed that older workers' social ties at higher organizational levels (upper reachability) and the number of social ties at work moderated the effect of the intervention on work engagement. Specifically, the intervention aimed at enhancing employees' personal resources improved work engagement for senior employees with few or no social ties at work with whom they could discuss important matters, and for those with social ties at higher organizational levels. However, the relationship quality between older workers and their leaders showed no moderation effect. This study encourages human resources professionals to consider the social network characteristics and peer learning of older workers when providing training to enhance their work engagement.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22182;Too smart to work hard? Investigating why overqualified employees engage in time theft behaviors. Integrating the theory of workplace deviance with person-environment fit theory, we propose a two-pathway model to explain why and how employees who feel overqualified engage in time theft behavior. Specifically, we anticipate that feeling overqualified will negatively influence focal employees' experienced authority fairness and erode their work meaningfulness, which in turn will lead to increased time theft behavior. Further, we argue that voice endorsement serves as a key boundary condition mitigating the negative effects of perceived overqualification. We conducted two multi-waved and multi-sourced field studies to test our proposed hypotheses. Study 1 (247 employees and 47 supervisors) revealed that perceived overqualification is associated with time theft behavior through the mediators of experienced authority fairness and meaningfulness. Study 2 (405 employees and 73 supervisors) replicated the findings of Study 1 and tested our full model. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22106;The curvilinear effect of perceived overqualification on constructive voice: The moderating role of leader consultation and the mediating role of work engagement. Drawing on the social cognitive theory of self-regulation, we proposed a model considering an inverted U-shaped relationship between perceived overqualification and constructive voice. We reasoned from the theory that this curvilinear effect would be moderated by leader consultation, which could intensify the upward curvilinear trend and neutralize the downward curvilinear trend, and be mediated by work engagement. We conducted two studies to test our model. In Study 1, based on a three-wave time-lagged sample of 293 employees and 120 supervisors, we found an inverted U-shaped relationship between perceived overqualification and constructive voice, which was moderated by leader consultation. In Study 2, we examined the proposed mediated moderation model using a sample of 231 matched leader-subordinate dyads. We found that, at lower levels, perceived overqualification has a positive association with constructive voice, which is mediated by work engagement, especially at higher leader consultation. At higher levels, perceived overqualification has a negative association with work engagement and thus constructive voice, especially at lower levels of leader consultation. The implications of our research are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22097;Pre-crisis commitment human resource management and employees' attitudes in a global pandemic: The role of trust in the government. Studies of human resource management (HRM) have produced plentiful results on commitment HRM, but its effects during a crisis have rarely been examined. Incorporating the commitment HRM view and the cognitive phenomenological framework, we examined whether and how commitment HRM practices implemented prior to the COVID-19 mitigate employees' negative cognitive evaluations and attitudes during the pandemic. Moreover, a pandemic is a situation that requires strong government interventions, and we further examined whether employees' trust in the government would play a moderating role in explaining the effects of commitment HRM. With a multilevel framework, we measured commitment HRM via an analysis of big data provided online prior to the pandemic and matched the information to employees' responses collected from a survey after the outbreak of the pandemic. With data from 1010 employees and 52 companies, we found that employees in organizations with a higher utilization of commitment HRM showed less threat appraisals. Moreover, those experiencing fewer threat appraisals showed more commitment to their organizations. In addition, we found that the negative link between a company's commitment HRM and its employees' threat appraisals was pronounced when they had a lower level of trust in the government. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22085;What you see is what you get? Measuring companies' projected employer image attributes via companies' employment webpages. Information on a company's employment webpage sends signals about the employer image the company intends to project to applicants. Nonetheless, we know little about the content of recruitment signals sent via company employment webpages. This study develops a method to measure companies' projected employer image attributes based on their employment webpages. Specifically, we analyze companies' projected employer image attributes by applying computer-aided text analysis (CATA) to the employment webpages of 461 Fortune 500 companies (i.e., more than 11,100 individual pages). Our results show that projected employer image attributes remain relatively stable over time. Moreover, we find relatively low levels of employer image differentiation between companies and between industries. Only a small group of companies (<20%) use distinct employer attribute signals to communicate their projected employer image. Finally, there is limited convergence between projected employer image attributes based on employment webpages and ratings on similar attributes on employer review websites. Generally, our results show that CATA is a viable method for assessing companies' projected employer image in the context of employer image management and engineering.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22080;Performance management systems and multinational enterprises: Where we are and where we should go. In this comprehensive summary, we take a critical look at the state of performance management systems in multinational enterprises, summarizing what we have learned to this point, and speculating on where the field should go. We specifically address four challenges (i) can performance really be managed? (ii) if so, how do we go about doing this? (iii) the need to balance consistency across locations with the need to accommodate unique realities of individual locations, and (iv) addressing the different employee profiles - i.e., expatriates vs. host country nationals. In terms of what we have learned to this point, we believe that global organizations need to pay more attention to (i) performance context, (ii) ratee reactions, and (iii) rater motivation, as these are integral to successful performance management. On the other hand, they might re-consider and re-visit the amount of time and energy spent on factors such as (i) appraisal forms and (ii) rater training, as these may not be serving any useful purpose. We next discuss the unique challenges faced by multinational enterprises, including (i) the type of strategy a corporation might employ (Bartlett & Ghoshal, 1998), (ii) the different cultures of the nations where the organization operates (Hofstede et al., 2010), and (iii) managing the performance of expatriates (Toh & DeNisi, 2007). Looking ahead, we would like to remind multinational corporations (and all other corporations) that culture and context matter, but these must be addressed in concert with the need to treat all employees fairly and consistently. We conclude by proposing several research ideas, including the need to explore the potential role of host country nationals in the performance management process for multinational enterprises.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22056;Home and host distal context and performance appraisal in multinational enterprises: A 22 country study. Context is a central construct in the study of performance appraisal (PA) systems, but to date studies linking the distal context within which organizations operate to PA have been limited in two ways. First, these studies have focused predominantly on national culture, and have paid less attention to the legal/political and economic environment within which organizations. Second, few studies reflect the growing international nature of business organizations, which create multiple layers of context (e.g., home and host country context). Drawing on both situational strength and institutional theories, we hypothesize the links between the big three facets of distal context (i.e., culture, legal/political, and economic) and the processes and purposes of PA systems. Using data from 472 multinational enterprises (MNEs) in 22 countries, we show that all three facets of the distal context of the host country influence decisions about the conduct of PA systems. In addition, we show that the culture and legal/political systems of the home country from which the MNE originated are also linked to the PA processes and purposes. Finally, we find evidence that MNEs are more likely to develop hybridized PA systems that depart from host country norms.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22227;Exploring representations of human resource management as moral dirty work: A film study. It has been claimed that the HR profession suffers from a chronic shortage of social legitimacy. In this article, we advance the idea that HR is also to some extent subject to public stigmatization for being immoral. In other words, we maintain that certain aspects of contemporary HR work can be conceptualized as morally dirty work. We provide empirical support for this contention by analyzing a set of 28 films portraying HR practitioners at work. The research results comprise both task-related and method-related filmic representations of HR work as immoral, thus furnishing a comprehensive and nuanced picture of the moral issues that can affect the HR profession. Furthermore, the results show that some of the HR characters analyzed-typically those who hold a role as (co-)protagonists in the story-realize the immorality affecting their work and decide to distance themselves from it by either exiting the role, trying to reform it, or openly raising resistance against their employer. These research results suggest the need to integrate dirty work scholarship into study of the HR profession, while they provide important indications in terms of future HR research, practice and education.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22191;Delayed pay and employee turnover: The buffering role of pay-for-performance. In response to a financial crisis, many organizations adjust their pay systems to reduce labor costs. In this research, we focus on the use of delayed pay (the postponement of employees' contractual compensation) and examine its effect on employee voluntary turnover outcomes. In a field study (Study 1) with data collected from the executive managers of 129 Chinese hotels experiencing a financial crisis caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we find a positive relationship between delayed pay and the voluntary turnover rate at the organizational level. In addition, this relationship becomes weaker when delayed pay consists of a larger proportion of pay-for-performance (PFP). We then conduct an experiment (Study 2) to extend our theoretical framework to the individual level, establish causality, and examine the underlying mechanism. The results show that the perceived negative instrumentality of stay (i.e., expected economic losses associated with staying in an organization) explains why individuals intend to leave organizations adopting delayed base pay but not delayed PFP. We further replicate these findings in a critical incident technique study (Study 3). We also discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22184;How the human resource (HR) function adds strategic value: A relational perspective of the HR function. In the present article, we propose the concept of the HR function's relational activities and examine its influence on the firm's human capital resources (HCRs) and performance. Integrating insights from various streams of research in strategic human resource management (HRM) and strategic human capital, we develop a relational perspective of the HR function and propose the relational activities as the HR function's advisory and informative activities toward its internal stakeholders (i.e., line managers, employees, and senior managers) to help the stakeholders meet their goals and needs. In our framework, we theorize how the HR function's relational activities lead to superior firm performance by enhancing the firm's HCRs and identify the firm's strategic HR systems and human capital losses as factors that complement and necessitate the HR function's relational activities, respectively. Using a five-wave, nationally representative panel dataset covering 1415 firm observations, we find robust support for our hypotheses: the HR function's relational activities were positively related to HCRs, which was more pronounced when coupled with high levels of strategic HR systems and human capital losses. The HCRs, in turn, transmitted the effects of the relational activities on the firm's subsequent operational and financial performance. Overall, these findings develop strategic HRM theory by contributing a more comprehensive conceptualization of the HR function's role in the strategic HRM process and by revealing its effects on firm performance along with key moderators.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22163;Looking up and fitting in: Team leaders' and members' behaviors and attitudes toward the environment in an MNC. As an emerging topic in human resource management (HRM) research, organizational citizenship behavior for the environment (OCBE) and workgroup green advocacy (WGGA) have been studied as a proxy of the environmental performance of organizations as well as a potential way for companies to assess the impact of their environmental strategies and initiatives. Viewing OCBE and WGGA as green-focused knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics and building on leader-member exchange theory, we examined the effects of leaders' OCBE and WGGA, person-supervisor fit (PSF), and person-group fit (PGF) as well as their potential interactions on members' OCBE and WGGA. To minimize the potential impact of different company strategies, the study was conducted in one MNC using a sample of 269 members from 64 teams. The results revealed that PSF and especially PGF were associated with members' OCBE and WGGA, but leaders' OCBE was a stronger predictor of members' OCBE and WGGA than leaders' WGGA. Contrary to our prediction, no moderating effect of PSF or PGF was found for the associations between leaders' and members' WGGA and OCBE. Together, these findings shed light on the differential trickle-down effects of leaders' perceptions and behaviors in the context of environmental management. As for the implications for HRM practitioners, our findings suggest companies may focus on leaders' OCBE and WGGA as well as on PSF and PGF independently as the means to shaping team members' OCBE and WGGA to support environmental strategies.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22128;Sparking creativity using extrinsic rewards: A self-determination theory perspective. The relationship between extrinsic rewards and creativity has been subject to ongoing debate within the human resource management and creativity literatures. More research on the mechanisms and boundary conditions has been called for. In this study, using 187 employee-supervisor dyads in an electronics manufacturing company, we investigated how and when creativity-contingent extrinsic rewards (CER) may foster creativity among manufacturing employees. Drawing on self-determination theory, we hypothesized, and found that employee intrinsic motivation mediated the relationship between CER and employee creativity. This relationship was the strongest when employees rated their leader-member exchange (LMX) as high. The findings reveal the important role of CER in guiding manufacturing employees' intrinsic motivation and stimulating creativity. The identification of LMX as a moderator uncovers crucial boundary conditions of this relationship. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22110;Is shooting for fairness always beneficial? The influence of promotion fairness on employees' cognitive and emotional reactions to promotion failure. Promotions, as a part of organizational incentive and reward systems, can motivate employees to perform well and to increase commitment to their firms. But very little is known about why and when promotion failure influences employees' subsequent responses. Integrating social-cognitive theory and the cognitive appraisal theory of emotion in justice literature, we investigated the effect of promotion failure on employees' work engagement through cognitive and emotional processes and the moderating effects of perceived promotion fairness. Employing two survey studies (Study 1 and Study 2) and an experimental study (Study 3), we found that: (1) promotion failure was negatively related to self-efficacy and positively associated with anger;art;" (4) promotion fairness perception strengthened the indirect negative relationship between promotion failure and work engagement through self-efficacy but weakened this indirect relationship via anger. Our work contributes to promotion and justice literature and enlightens practitioners about how to manage promotion practice."",art";;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22079;Leveraging green HRM for firm performance: The joint effects of CEO environmental belief and external pollution severity and the mediating role of employee environmental commitment. The topic of green human resource management (HRM) has drawn increasing attention of HRM scholars in the past decade. Recent research has called for more studies to identify the antecedents of green HRM used in organizations and explore the mediating mechanisms through which green HRM is related to performance outcomes. This study represents an effort to address these research needs by examining the joint effects of chief executive officer (CEO) environmental belief and external pollution severity on the use of green HRM and testing the mediating role of employee environmental commitment in the relationship between green HRM and firm performance. Drawing upon data collected from multiple sources (i.e., survey data from chief executive officer (CEOs), chief financial officers (CFOs), HR managers and employees, and archival data from government statistics), we found that CEO's environmental belief is significantly related to the use of green HRM, especially for companies operating in locations with severer pollution. Green HRM in turn has a positive relationship with the firm's environmental and financial performances via employee commitment to the environment. The findings highlight the often-overlooked role of in the strategic HRM literature pertinent to environmental management and clarify the antecedents and influential mechanisms of green HRM at the firm level of analysis. We also discuss theoretical and practical implications in this study.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22052;Sixty years of discrimination and diversity research in human resource management: A review with suggestions for future research directions. This article reviews discrimination and diversity research published in Human Resource Management (HRM) over the past 60 years. While discrimination and diversity are very different constructs, it is often informative to study them together, because when people recognize each other's diversity, this can result in bias, stereotyping, and discrimination. We conducted bibliographic searches for terms related to discrimination and diversity as well as a manual search through every title and abstract published in HRM over the last 60 years to assess article relevance. The search resulted in 135 research articles with 136 unique studies (i.e., samples) which are reviewed in this article. Sex and race are the demographics that have been examined the most in HRM, while religion has been examined the least. Moreover, the number of studies examining lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) employees in the workplace in HRM has grown quickly within the past 10 years, culminating in a recent meta-analysis. Our review looks at some of the earliest research published, the most recent research published, and the overall trends we identified in the research over the years for both discrimination and diversity articles. We then make future research suggestions and recommendations to advance the study of discrimination and diversity in the coming years.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22268;Strategic Human Resource Management in the Era of Algorithmic Technologies: Key Insights and Future Research Agenda. This article presents a contemporary review of human resource management (HRM) research on algorithmic technologies, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing. By connecting these recent advancements to the long-standing scholarly tradition of HRM-technology relations, this review examines current knowledge on how algorithmic technologies are reshaping three key areas: (1) work structures and design, (2) HR delivery activities, and (3) the management of technology workers. Using a threefold conceptualization of technology-the tool view, proxy view, and ensemble view-this review explores how organizations employ algorithmic systems to enhance productivity, how the human agency interacts with and resists these technologies, and how broader social, cultural, and institutional contexts shape the use of algorithms in HRM. Additionally, this article offers suggestions for future research, highlighting the unique opportunities algorithmic technologies provide to HR scholars for making enduring contributions to the broader conversations on HRM and technology.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22256;Gender Differences in Job Requirements: Change Within Careers and Across Cohorts. We examine differences in jobs held by men and women based on a measure not used before, the standard human resources measures of knowledge, skills, and abilities generated by job analyses. While there is an abundance of evidence on gender disparities in pay, we know much less in detail about differences in the work men and women perform and especially how these differences have changed over time. We use nationally representative data for two cohorts of college graduates, one entering the post-college workforce in 1994 and another in 2009, and we follow them for the first 10 years of their careers. We find that women generally held jobs with lower requirements relative to men. The gender gap in job requirements grew over the course of individuals' careers for the first cohort (1994-2003) but declined sharply for the second (2009-2018). We also find that among the second cohort, women received a wage premium for social skills that was greater than what men received.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22255;Revitalizing Colleague-Specific Human Capital: Boomerang and Pipeline-Based Hiring in a 41-Year Multilevel Study of Employee Mobility. Amidst the decline of permanent employment contracts and the rapid shortening of career cycles, organizations often face challenges in fully capitalizing on employee mobility. This study adopts a multilevel perspective to explore how mobility impacts both individual and team performance, focusing on acquiring colleague-specific human capital through two talent acquisition strategies: boomerang hiring and pipeline-based hiring. Using a unique Major League Baseball database spanning 41 years, including 19,927 player-year records and 1156 team-year records, our analysis reveals that individuals engaged in boomerang and pipeline-based hiring and possessing higher levels of individual colleague-specific human capital, experience greater benefits from mobility in terms of individual performance. Moreover, these hiring strategies allow organizations to effectively harness colleague-specific human capital. Specifically, team performance is positively influenced by a greater proportion of boomerang hiring through team colleague-specific human capital resources. Similarly, a higher ratio of pipeline-based hiring, alongside other recurrent hiring practices, positively impacts team performance through team colleague-specific human capital resources. Our findings provide valuable insights for organizations aiming to rejuvenate their colleague-specific human capital resources through strategic hiring practices to achieve sustained success.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22247;Bridges and gatekeepers: Employees' willingness to refer qualified candidates on the autism spectrum. Recruiting neurodiverse talent has increasingly featured on the organizational diversity agenda, yet recruitment practices geared toward locating and attracting neurodivergent candidates remain understudied. While research and practice have shown that employee referral is one of the channels through which a significant part of new talent is recruited, little is known about employees' willingness to refer qualified social contacts who are neurodivergent. We address this limitation by investigating employees' willingness to refer highly qualified candidates on the autism spectrum and some conditions under which they are more or less likely to refer such candidates. We explore these aspects in a study of working individuals, using a mixed-method approach. The quantitative analysis shows that disclosure of an autism condition to potential referrers might pose some advantage, in that it increases the likelihood of being referred, but this advantage accrues only to male candidates. Furthermore, cues that hint at the social dimension of the ideal worker, commonly used in job recruitment materials, are the strongest deterrent for referrers. The qualitative analysis of the reasons behind decisions to refer sheds light on some mechanisms that might explain these findings.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1002/hrm.22083;How and when do prior international experiences lead to global work? A career motivation perspective. While research suggests a link between individuals' prior international experiences and their future participation in global work, we know little about how and the conditions under which this relationship occurs. Drawing on career motivation theory, we conceptualize global identity as a mediator between individuals' density of prior international experiences-defined as the extent to which time spent in culturally novel countries has provided individuals with developmental opportunities-and their global work aspirations, which in turn leads to their global work involvement. Further, this multi-stage mediation model holds mainly when individuals receive positive feedback regarding their intercultural competencies (i.e., cultural intelligence) from their peers. We test our model using a multi-wave multi-source dataset spanning 6 years. We discuss implications for the literatures on prior international experiences and global careers.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22059;Backlash in performance feedback: Deepening the understanding of the role of gender in performance appraisal. We explore one possible factor contributing to the proverbial glass ceiling for women-manifestation of the backlash effect, defined as social repercussions received by women who violate the female gender-role norm, in performance feedback. Feedback phrasing may have consequences for employee commitment to the organization and intention to leave. The results of study 1, a mixed qualitative and quantitative analysis of a sample of 400 written performance evaluations from two organizations, provide evidence of the backlash effect in the feedback language used in women's performance appraisals at all levels of the organizational hierarchy, not just for women in leadership roles as expected. The results of a self-report survey of 271 working adults (study 2) suggest differing sensitivity to the use of backlash-related words according to gender, unexpectedly pointing to lower sensitivity for women and evidence of shaping behaviors toward one's gender-role norm through positive feedback. Implications are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-03-2023-0263;Artificial intelligence-based virtual assistant and employee engagement: an empirical investigation. PurposeScholars have highlighted personal interactions between employees and their leaders in an increasingly distributed and hybrid work environment as an essential mechanism that engages employees toward organizational goals. Enhanced employee engagement significantly contributes to sustained organizational performance and growth. While Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in the HR domain are increasing, research to understand the implication of AI-based virtual assistants on enabling trust and managing human resources is, at best, limited.Design/methodology/approachDrawing on the social response theory and the social exchange theory, and based on a multi-source, time-lagged field study spanning over ten months, we investigated the impact of AI-based virtual assistants on employee attitudes, namely perception of fairness and employee engagement.FindingsThe usage of AI-based virtual assistants is associated directly with employee engagement and indirectly through employees' perceptions of fairness. While employees' past performance moderates the relationship between perceived fairness and employee engagement, the interaction effect becomes non-significant with AI-based virtual assistants.Research limitations/implicationsOur study contributes to the emerging literature on AI-based virtual assistants in HRM and employee engagement. The virtual assistants' use to enhance employee engagement emerges as an opportunity for task substitution and augmentation. Our study demonstrates that AI-based virtual assistants can enhance employee engagement and help build perceptions of fairness among employees.Originality/valueWith the emerging importance of AI, there is an increasing interest in explaining human-computer interactions and their effect on employee engagement. Our study is among the early empirical studies examining the implications of AI-based virtual assistants on employee outcomes.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-03-2024-0215;Managerial supplication and counterproductive work behavior: Do sadness, political skill and emotional intelligence matter?. PurposeCan managerial supplication lead subordinates to engage in undesirable work behavior? What role, if any, do negative emotions play in this process? Are there factors that moderate these emotions and their harmful implications? Relying on the affective events theory, the current study investigated these questions using a moderated mediation model in which: (a) perceived managerial supplication elicited sadness that resulted in counterproductive work behavior and (b) political skill and emotional intelligence moderated these relationships.Design/methodology/approachThe moderated mediation model was tested using a sample of 167 employees. The data were collected in three waves.FindingsPerceived managerial supplication was positively related to subordinates' sadness and both dimensions of counterproductive work behavior, namely, organizational and interpersonal counterproductive work behavior. Moreover, sadness was positively related to both dimensions of counterproductive work behavior and mediated the relationships between perceived supplication and these two undesirable outcomes. Nevertheless, contrary to our expectations, all moderation effects included in our model were insignificant.Practical implicationsHuman resource departments should implement training programs to develop the awareness of their managers about the harmful consequences of perceived supplication, encouraging them to use other behaviors with subordinates.Originality/valueThis study is the first to (a) suggest and validate the view that subordinates' perceptions about their managers' use of supplication can result in undesirable work behavior and (b) demonstrate that sadness, an emotion that is not associated with the tendency to express external aggression, can lead employees to engage in counterproductive work behavior toward both their organizations and colleagues.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-09-2022-0629;Training under an extreme context: the role of organizational support and adaptability on the motivation transfer and performance after training. PurposeThe present study used the job-demands and resources (JD-R) framework to understand how the training is transferred to an extreme working context through the analysis of job and personal resources (social support from the leader and colleagues and adaptability). Specifically, the authors tested the mediating role of motivation to transfer in the relationship (1) between the perceived support from the supervisor and colleagues and performance after training and (2) between adaptability and performance in an extreme context of the pandemic crisis - the first peak of COVID-19 in Portugal. Further, an inspection of the factors that predicted knowledge transfer and adaptability under an extreme context was carried out.Design/methodology/approachTo do so, necessary training about the new safety rules regarding the pandemic crisis of COVID-19 was implemented in a healthcare institution as a strategy to help healthcare workers deal with the increasing uncertainty and complexity that was threatening their work. It consisted of three sessions (each with one hour of training) regarding procedures, rules and safety norms. The training occurred in May 2020. Overall, 291 healthcare workers participated in the study and answered one online questionnaire one week after training completion.FindingsThe results showed that the motivation to transfer had a significant indirect effect on the relationship between colleagues' and supervisors' support and performance and between adaptability and performance. Additionally, complementary analyses showed that the mediations depended on the levels of self-efficacy in such a way that the indirect relationships were stronger when self-efficacy was higher. Thus, adaptability and support, both from colleagues and the supervisor, are determining factors for knowledge transfer and resultant performance in extreme contexts, such as the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Lastly, the results showed that the most significant predictors of transference were self-efficacy and the motivation to transfer the learned knowledge. On the other hand, self-efficacy, peer support and the opportunity to use the knowledge were the most significant predictors of adaptability.Practical implicationsThese findings provide support for the role of employee motivation to transfer as a mechanism connecting both perceived support and adaptability to performance outcomes under extreme working contexts.Originality/valueThis study, conducted in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic context - an extreme and uncertain working context - shows the relevance of both job and individual factors to predict employees' adaptability to such contexts.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-12-2022-0892;Is it time to rethink benefit packages? Perks associated with the intention to leave in different age groups during COVID-19. PurposeThe study's objective is to estimate the association of specific perceived employer-provided benefits on employees' intention to leave in different age cohorts during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Informed by the psychological theories of ageing, the authors propose three age-cohort-specific hypotheses in three motivational domains: security and health benefits, flexible work arrangement and education-related benefits.Design/methodology/approachThe authors use a large survey of employees in Estonia (n = 7,209) conducted in 2020 and test the association of specific benefits and their interactions with age on employees' intention to leave.FindingsThe results show that older cohorts are generally less prone to leave their jobs. Benefits that employers could use during the COVID-19 crisis generally had negative associations with the intention to leave, but age-specific differences were negligible;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-12-2022-0883;The moderating effects of relative racio-ethnicity on the inclusion to health to turnover intentions relationship. PurposeThis study extends work on the role of the organizational context in contributing to employee health by investigating whether an employee's status as a racio-ethnic minority in his or her work group will moderate the relationship between perceived work group inclusion and health, which in turn will predict turnover intentions.Design/methodology/approachData were collected from two samples of full-time employees across multiple organizations. Hypotheses were tested using Hayes's (2013) PROCESS macro in SPSS.FindingsSupport was found for moderation with regard to perceived inclusion predicting negative health but not positive health. Both negative health and positive health predicted turnover intentions.Research limitations/implicationsFindings support the importance of perceived inclusion for employee health, and the research extends prior studies that have been conducted in non-work settings.Practical implicationsProviding a work environment in which work group members perceive inclusion could be useful in terms of reducing health issues for employees, especially for those who are racio-ethnic minorities in their work group.Originality/valueThis study extends prior work by investigating relative minority status within the work group, and it highlights the potential impact of inclusion on employee health.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1108/PR-02-2022-0128;Does workplace ostracism negatively affect family life during a pandemic?. PurposeThe study aims to investigate the impact of workplace ostracism (WO) and fear of the COVID-19 pandemic on the family life of restaurant employees. This research is based on the conservation of resources (COR) theory and work-family interface model to understand the theoretical underpinnings of mistreatment in the food sector during the COVID-19 pandemic.Design/methodology/approachThe study utilized a survey with a structured questionnaire to collect time-lagged data from 238 restaurant employees in the central region of Punjab province in Pakistan. The collected data were analyzed using the SPSS tool with modern-day techniques like bootstrapping, process macro and SmartPLS.FindingsThe study reveals that perceived stress levels of the employees increase due to ostracism, leading to work-family conflict. Furthermore, the study found that employees who fear COVID-19 are less stressed by ostracism.Originality/valueThe study's significant contribution lies in demonstrating that the impact of ostracism in the workplace is quite different from what was expected. The results have shown that ostracism can reduce the perceived stress levels of employees, leading to a decrease in work-family conflict, especially in the presence of fear of COVID-19.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2022-0308;Evasive (knowledge) hiding and task performance: the moderating role of accumulative job resources. PurposeBuilding on the premise of conservation of resources theory (COR) that people protect their knowledge as a resource, the authors questioned whether the contextual nature of job resources buffers the counterintuitive positive relationship between evasive knowledge hiding (KH) and task performance.Design/methodology/approachTwo multisource field survey studies were conducted to examine the moderating influence of task-job resources on the knowledge hiders' task performance. Hierarchical regression analyses tested the main effect of evasive KH on task performance. In addition, conditional process analyses were applied to examine two-way and three-way interactions of evasive KH, job autonomy and task variety.FindingsThe data analysis showed a positive relationship between evasive KH and task performance. Moreover, the authors found that employees receiving accumulative task-job resources continued to hide knowledge and used abundant resources to increase their task performance further. However, contrary to expectations, for employees-who received partial task-job resources-their task performance deteriorated when evasively hiding knowledge.Practical implicationsManagers and human resource practitioners should acknowledge that employees' evasive KH to co-workers is not always wrong and should not be treated like it is. Moreover, they are endorsed to pay attention and invest in job resources since job autonomy and task variety create a beneficial context for knowledge holders' task performance.Originality/valueThe authors provided novel theoretical (the gain-loss perspective of COR theory) and consistent empirical (confirmed by two field-study evidence) arguments for an important contextual role of an HRM practice of job design in shaping the underrepresented knowledge behavior-task performance relationship.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-11-2021-0835;High-performance work systems in public service units: examining the social capital and ambidexterity as mediating process. Purpose This study clarifies how intra-organizational social capital (IOSC) and unit-organizational ambidexterity (UOA), using resource-based view and dynamic capability theory, together support organizational value creation. While there is research in strategic human resource management (SHRM) exploring the role of resources and its uses, there remains limited understanding of how resources are linked and their effective utilization in the service sector. This study aims to examine the mediating process linking employee-experienced service-oriented high-performance work systems (SHPWS) experienced by employees and service performance by integrating IOSC and UOA. Design/methodology/approach This study uses time lagged data from managers and employees of different branches of Chinese state-owned banks. To test the proposed hypotheses, path analysis was applied. Findings The path analysis results reveal that employee-experienced SHPWS is an important antecedent of service performance. Moreover, IOSC (as resources) and UOA (uses) strongly mediate the theorized relationship. Originality/value This study attempts to refine theory and practice with clearer, more insightful and coherent means to better understand and help unpack the 'black box' between SHPWS-performance relationships through a new linkage model.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-08-2019-0419;Understanding flexibility i-deals: integrating performance motivation in the context of Colombia. Purpose The goal of this study is to explore the consequences of flexibility i-deals in work and non-work domains of employees. Design/methodology/approach A matched supervisor-subordinate sample context drawn from a security organization in Chile (N = 3,624 subordinates matched with 107 supervisors) was used which is an unrepresented context in research on i-deals. Findings Results from multi-level analyses reveal that the interaction of performance motivation of subordinates and flexibility i-deals matters to performance motivation of subordinates. In turn, performance motivation reduces turnover intentions and work-family conflict of subordinates. Research limitations/implications The findings from multi-level structural equation modelling supported our hypotheses and offered interesting implications for the i-deals literature and practitioners. Our findings highlight (1) the importance of being performance driven to obtain flexibility i-deals and (2) the enabling role of performance-oriented supervisors. Practical implications Flexibility i-deals act as mechanism that translate the impact of performance motivation on key work and non-work outcomes and can be considered as important HR tools for employees and managers. Originality/value This research highlights the importance of performance motivation to obtain i-deals and emphasises that the motivation of supervisors is key to enable these deals. Furthermore, the context of this research, which is a security organisation, is important as research to date has been conducted in Western and corporate settings.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-03-2021-0154;Individual agency and structure perceptions in intentions to withdrawal from work early/late in the mid-and late-career. Purpose In the context of an aging workforce and uncertain labor markets, it is a priority to identify and analyze what factors influence intentions regarding motivation to continue working, how and when to retire. From the life course perspective, this paper aims to capture the individual agency and structure perceptions to withdrawal from work early/late intentions in the mid- and late-career, identifying voluntary/involuntary factors underlying these intentions. Design/methodology/approach Hypotheses were tested using multiple regression analyses based on a cross-sectional design, with a representative sample of 414 Chilean workers over the age of 45. Findings The results depict several patterns of contextual factors operating at different levels underlying mid- and late-career-related intentions. Specifically, they identify how perceptions of individual agency and structure are significantly associated with voluntary and involuntary factors that guide intentions to stay working or retire early, as well as to prolong working life and to lean toward bridge employment. Originality/value This study contributes to identifying perceptions of individual agency and structure in career intentions and can help individuals and organizations clarify the voluntary and involuntary factors behind work-life intentions in their middle and final career stages. In addition, the results can contribute to international research in this field by providing information on the underrepresented Ibero-American context.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-09-2020-0729;Mentoring and coping self-efficacy as predictors of affective occupational commitment for women in STEM. Purpose Despite an evident increase in the number of women joining Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) majors at universities, the recruitment and retainment of women in STEM occupations continue to be a substantial challenge. The aim of this research is to investigate several individual and contextual factors that could increase the representation of women in STEM fields. Design/methodology/approach The authors report the results of a questionnaire survey of women (n = 375) working in STEM industries in the Middle East and North Africa region who have or had a mentor during their careers. Structural equation modelling is used to examine the proposed hypotheses. Findings The results indicate that both mentoring and coping self-efficacy positively influence affective occupational commitment. Coping self-efficacy is also found to partially mediate the relationship between mentoring and affective occupational commitment. Practical implications The authors recommend that researchers and practitioners give more attention to the contextual factors such as mentoring and its contribution to the coping self-efficacy and affective occupational commitment of employees in STEM occupations. Originality/value In this study, the authors investigate individual and contextual factors that have potential to enhance women's occupational commitment in STEM industries based on the Career Self-Management Model.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-03-2021-0199;Time for life? The spillover effect of strain-based family-to-work conflict on early retirement intentions and the role of HR practice flexibility. Purpose To cope with the workforce shortages brought by population ageing, it is critical to understand the workplace micro-foundations that determine the mechanisms of older workers' early retirement intentions. Drawing on the conservation of resource theory, this study examines the spillover effect of strain-based family-to-work conflict (SFWC) on early retirement intentions, with emotional exhaustion as a mediator. Additionally, it investigates the contextual resources, HR practice flexibility, as a boundary condition for the above relationships. Design/methodology/approach The study tests the hypotheses by employing a multi-sourced matching sample of 231 workers (aged 45-65) and their 49 managers. Findings The results of cross-level analysis revealed that SFWC has a positive indirect relationship with early retirement intentions, through increased emotional exhaustion. The relationship between emotional exhaustion and early retirement intentions is weaker when older employees experience higher HR practice flexibility. Originality/value This study is the first to use a resources perspective to analyse early retirement mechanisms, and it examines the spillover effect of SFWC on early retirement intentions. The findings also contribute to the literature on the role of HR practice for ageing workers.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-07-2020-0506;The joint impact of servant leadership and team-based HRM practices on team expediency: the mediating role of team reflexivity. Purpose This study focuses on an emerging deviant behavior at the team level and investigates when and why the team level processes reduce team expedient behavior. Anchored on the input-process-outcome (I-P-O) theoretical framework for studying team effectiveness, it conceptualizes and tests a research model where servant leadership and team-based human resource management (HRM practices) serve as a team-level input that interacts to influence the process of team reflexivity and ultimately reduces team expedient behavior as the outcome. Design/methodology/approach Data are from 109 teams involving a total of 584 employees and analyzed at the team level. Findings The findings provide empirical support that team-based HRM practices positively moderate the relationship between servant leadership and team reflexivity and that team reflexivity transforms the influence of servant leadership into reduced team expedient behavior. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. Research limitations/implications The participants in this study were drawn from diverse backgrounds (n = 584), and they were nested within 109 teams. Therefore, the authors were cautious of making claims that the findings would apply to every team in the context of China. The authors acknowledge that the research design of this study is not the strongest to test for causal relationship. Practical implications The findings show the synergistic role of servant leadership and team-based HRM practices and suggest organizations have both in place to mitigate deviant behaviors by teams. The study also suggests organizations develop and promote an environment where team members are motivated and encouraged to share their ideas, openly discuss experiences and set up forward plans. Social implications Organizations should focus on training their leaders of the behaviors such as supporting followers, enhancing subordinates' commitment to the collective goal and emphasizing the equality between themselves and subordinates. Organizations need to increase their awareness that the teams are more likely to perform their tasks by the means prescribed by the organizational rules if they communicate, discuss and get modeling or feedback from other teams. Originality/value This study enriches research on team-based HRM practices, which so far have received limited attention, and deserves further investigation. It sharpens the underlying mechanism that translates team-level input of leadership and HRM to the desired outcomes of reduced expedient behavior by introducing the role of team reflexivity. The study adds to the growing research on workplace deviance by addressing team-level expedient behavior.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-03-2020-0135;How triple-role conflicts of Chinese enterprise trade unions impact employees' satisfaction: rights expectation as moderator. Purpose This paper aims to explore the extent to which unionized employees are dissatisfied in Chinese Enterprise Trade Unions (CETUs) when they perceive high levels of the triple-role conflicts, as well as whether rights expectations will moderate these relationships. The authors define CETUs' triple-role conflicts as the extent to which CETUs and their cadres prioritize fulfilling the roles of preserving social stability (peace) and/or maintaining the production order (production) over protecting worker's rights and interests (workers rights). Design/methodology/approach Pilot study developed the scales via both qualitative and quantitative studies, which include item generation using the transcript of individual interviews with 36 informants, and exploratory factor analyses with 106 respondents. The study used a sample of 327 employees from more than 20 firms in North and Southwest China. Findings Results indicate high reliability and validity of the scales and provide largely consistent supports for our hypotheses: three dimensions of triple-role conflicts are negatively related to employees' satisfaction in CETUs, and rights expectations moderate these relationships. Originality/value This study developed three scales to respectively measure CETUs' triple-role conflicts, rights expectation and satisfaction in CETUs. More importantly, the findings shed light on the moderating mechanism of rights expectation in the relationships between triple-role conflicts and satisfaction in CETUs.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2020-0073;Retention intention: does having a proactive personality matter?. Purpose In this study, the authors examine how employees' retention intentions are related to their proactive personalities through the theoretical lens of the model of motivational force of turnover and the model of proactive motivation. More specifically, the authors also verify the partial mediation of work engagement on the main relationship and moderation of high-performance human resource practices (HPHRPs) in the process, which has rarely been explored previously. Design/methodology/approach The hypothesized model was tested using partial least squares structural equational modeling on a sample of 221 employees of a bank in Bangladesh. Findings The results showed that having a proactive personality is positively related to retention intentions due to enhanced work engagement. However, the effect of the interaction between having a proactive personality and HPHRPs was found to be not significant on work engagement and retention intention. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature by exploring the reason behind mixed results found in the relationship between having a proactive personality and retention intentions through work engagement as a mediator and HPHRPs as a contextual boundary condition in a single model.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2020-0474;A new, established approach to managing misbehavior: system justification theory. Purpose - The status quo for managing deviant workplace behavior is underperforming. The current research offers a new approach for scholars and managers in approaching these misbehaviors. Namely, we outline how system justification theory, which holds that people are motivated to rationalize and justify the systems-including workplaces-to which they belong even when those systems disadvantage them or others, offers value in explaining and addressing the prevalence of such misbehaviors and contemporary failures in managing them.Design/methodology/approach - This conceptual research explores the situated role of onlookers to patterns of workplace misbehavior, like harassment. We explore existing scholarship on why and how onlookers respond to such actions, including cultural elements, and draw parallels between those accounts and the foundational concepts of system justification theory to demonstrate an unrealized theoretical overlap valuable for its immediate applications in research.Findings - The current paper establishes clear links between system justification theory and efforts to manage misbehavior, establishing system justifications as freezing forces in the culture of a workplace that must be unfrozen to successfully implement strategies for managing misbehavior. Further, we describe how organizational onlookers to misbehavior are subject to system justifications, which limit prescribed means of stopping these patterns of wrongdoing.Originality/value - Very limited organizational scholarship has utilized system justification theory, despite calls for such applications. Given the existing shortcomings in scholarship and management approaches to workplace misbehavior, the current research breaks from the status quo and offers an established theory as a new way to approach these misbehaviors.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22260;The Consequences of Age Discrimination via Perceived Work Ability: Downstream Effects on Well-Being, Performance, and Motivation. The workforce is aging and becoming more age-diverse. To better support people working across the lifespan, it is important to understand the barriers they face and the consequences of such barriers. Drawing on the job demands-resources model, we evaluate the negative effects of age discrimination on employees' perceived work ability and the subsequent consequences for employee well-being, performance, and motivation. Using two field samples, with two and three data collection time-points respectively, we hypothesize and find support for age discrimination's direct negative effect on perceived work ability. Moreover, we find support for our hypotheses that age discrimination will have negative indirect effects on employee well-being, performance, and motivation through perceived work ability. Together, these studies contribute to the aging workforce literature and extend both the age discrimination and work ability literatures by identifying a mechanism through which age discrimination leads to negative consequences for employee well-being and work outcomes.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Drawing on social resources theory, we examine the impact of developmental job experience (DJE) on employees' job performance and the role of the team context in this relationship. In a multisource, multiwave dataset of 354 employees working on 40 teams in seven Chinese companies, we find that DJE has a positive indirect relationship with job performance through increasing employees' information and support seeking. This positive indirect relationship is stronger for employees on teams with a high average DJE and low variance in DJE;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22141;Building then dismantling relational coordination: Mechanisms that distinguish functional and dysfunctional dynamics between HR practices and relational coordination. With the growing importance of relational coordination in today's multidisciplinary, interdependent work environment, practitioners are faced with challenges in designing and implementing relationship-oriented HR practices. We aim to identify key mechanisms either enabling or inhibiting the functional interplay between HR practices and relational coordination. Through an inductive qualitative study of a newsroom organization in Korea before and after the changes in its HR practices, we compared and contrasted functional and dysfunctional dynamics among HR practices, interpersonal relationships, and relational coordination. Before the changes, reporters coordinated across levels and functions as HR practices integrated formal and informal interactions and supported the shared notion on which professional behaviors and values are expected of a reporter. However, with the changes in HR practices, relational coordination among reporters dismantled as they experienced segregation between formal and informal interactions and upheld two different notions of journalistic values. Reporters were divided into two separate informal groups which rarely overlapped with formal work groups and these segregated interactions prevented reporters from sharing knowledge across levels and functions. Further, with the conflicting notion of journalistic values, reporters constantly debated over specific goals of practicing journalism and expressed disrespect toward those who held a different set of journalistic values. These findings redirect research by highlighting the fragility of relational coordination and the importance of designing HR practices which reflect formal and informal relational dynamics among employees and consolidate members under the same shared notion of professional values.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22093;High commitment work systems and employee well-being: The roles of workplace friendship and task interdependence. Human resource (HR) practices are potent in shaping workplace social relationships, which play a crucial role in employees' well-being. While the role of formal relationships (i.e., relationships based on prescribed work roles) has received relatively more research attention, little is known about the nexus between HR practices, informal relationships at work and employee well-being. Drawing on social interdependence theory, we conducted two studies to investigate how high commitment work systems (HCWS) affect employee well-being through workplace friendship, beyond the effects of formal interpersonal relationships. In Study 1, using time-lagged data from a sample of 253 full-time employees, we found that workplace friendship, a type of informal relationship at work, mediated the relationship between HCWS and employee well-being. In addition, task interdependence strengthened the relationship between HCWS and workplace friendship as well as the indirect effect of HCWS on employee well-being. In Study 2, we replicated these findings and extended them to multiple forms of well-being using multilevel data collected at three time points from 310 employees in 61 organizations. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings as well as future research directions are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22054;The double-edged sword of job crafting: The effects of job crafting on changes in job demands and employee well-being. Job crafting is theorized to operate via changes that employees make to their work designs, yet this critical mechanism has remained scarcely tested. This study examined whether job crafting facilitates changes in two types of challenge demands, namely workload and job complexity, and hindrance demands and whether these changes explain why job crafting may have both positive and negative implications for employee well-being. We utilized a two-wave sample of 2,453 employees to examine the relationships between job crafting and within-person changes in job demands, work engagement, and burnout. The findings showed that approach type of job crafting was related to increases in work engagement via increased job complexity. However, approach crafting was also associated with increases in burnout via increased workload. Avoidance type of job crafting, in turn, was related to increases in burnout and decreases in work engagement via decreased job complexity. The findings imply that job crafting may both promote and mitigate employee well-being depending on how it changes specific features of work design and that also approach crafting may deteriorate well-being. We discuss the practical implications of different types of job crafting on work design and employee well-being.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-09-2022-0608;The Great Resignation in the UK - reality, fake news or something in between?. Purpose - The purpose of this review is to understand whether The Great Resignation has emerged as a concept within the popular media and academic because it is based on fact or whether it has emerged because it broadly aligns with a dominant neoliberal ideology.Design/methodology/approach - This paper critically reviews United Kingdom (UK) government data to establish evidence for The Great Resignation. Thus, the purpose is to understand whether there has been an increased propensity for workers to leave or change their jobs due to attitudinal changes emerging from the experience of the Covid-19 pandemic.Findings - Based on this review, there is limited evidence that The Great Resignation has been occurring within the UK. Nonetheless, there have been extensive commentries in both the popular press and academic outlets that have been attempting to evidence the phenomenon. Some of academic writing is drirven by narratives emerging from the press which should thus warrent consideration of the extent to which academics are losing control over conceptual and theoretical development.Originality/value - The key contribution that is made by this piece is the questioning of concepts that have entered the common vernacular. Concepts such as The Great Resignation and Quiet Quitting have, for the most part, gained popularity through social media. This paper looks at The Great Resignation and warns of the possibility that social media maybe a significant threat to robust academic theorisation.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2021-0243;The quality of working life from a person-centred perspective: linking job crafting, work environment types and work engagement. Purpose The current study inspects pathways through which job crafting relates to the quality of employees' working lives. To date, this has been mostly done either by linking job crafting to individual job characteristics or by investigating its association with separate aspects of occupational well-being (such as work engagement), whereas empirical evidence about how it may affect one's overall work situation remains scarce. Design/methodology/approach To address this question, the authors conducted latent profile analyses based on selected job resources and job demands, which allowed the authors to derive distinct work environment patterns prevailing in a heterogeneous sample of 1,064 employees. Four patterns were identified denoting a passive, high-strain, low-strain and optimally balanced work environment types. The authors then tested the hypothesis that job crafting would relate to employees' odds of exposure to these patterns and that the latter would differentiate between high and low work engagement. Findings Approach job crafting was related to higher odds of being exposed to a favourably balanced work environment, and the reverse was true of avoidance crafting. Work engagement differed as a function of the quality of the work environment. Furthermore, the results suggested a potentially indirect link between approach job crafting and work engagement via exposure to different work environment types, whereas avoidance crafting related to lower work engagement only directly. Originality/value The findings contribute to theory testing and practice by providing a holistic representation of the work environment and then interlinking its features with employee proactivity and engagement.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-07-2021-0548;Localization in the United Arab Emirates: a study of stereotypes, organizational socialization, employability and work outcomes. Purpose This paper aims to extend the traditional conceptualization of localization, which has largely focused on recruitment, by examining employability and retention as crucial determinants of localization success. Design/methodology/approach Using survey data from local (Emirati) employees in private sector organizations in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the authors develop a holistic model of localization and test the relationships between stereotypes, organizational socialization, employability and retention outcomes, using Smart-PLS. Findings Among the main findings are the significant influence of stereotypes on organizational socialization (OS) experiences of Emirati employees, with a negative relationship between work ethics stereotypes and perceptions of OS experiences. Strong evidence is also found for the indirect effects of OS experiences on retention of Emirati employees, mediated by employability. Research limitations/implications This study contributes to the literature on localization by examining the relationships between key variables not examined together in previous research. In terms of limitations, the cross-sectional nature of the study prevents the identification of direction of causality among these relationships. Since employee integration, as part of localization efforts, is a gradual process, future research should include longitudinal studies. Practical implications Employability has emerged as a significant challenge for organizations and governments working to implement successful localization initiatives. This study's findings highlight several opportunities for organizational and governmental policy interventions to support successful localization. Originality/value The authors' holistic model extends localization literature by providing evidence for the role of stereotypes and employability as key constructs to be examined along with OS experiences and retention.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2021-0228;Leader favorable feedback and withdrawal behavior: a moderated mediation model of gratitude and leader-member exchange. Purpose This study investigates why and when leader favorable feedback inhibits employees' withdrawal behaviors. The authors propose that leader favorable feedback reduces employees' withdrawal behaviors via employees' gratitude toward the leader. The authors further posit that this mediation is contingent on leader-member exchange, arguing that as the quality of leader-member exchange increases, employees are more likely to feel grateful and are less likely to withdraw from work. Design/methodology/approach Two-wave, multisource field data collected from 662 employees were used to test our hypotheses. Findings Employees' feelings of gratitude mediated the negative relationship between leader favorable feedback and employees' withdrawal behavior. The negative effect of gratitude on withdrawal behavior was stronger under higher levels of leader-member exchange, as was the indirect effect of leader favorable feedback on withdrawal behavior via employees' gratitude. Originality/value These results contribute to a social exchange-based understanding of gratitude as an emotional mechanism underlying the feedback and withdrawal relationship and provide important practical implications for managers.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-08-2020-0649;Learning with the devil: mentoring and advocates. Purpose The purpose of this research was to understand the lived experience of mentoring to provide insight for those who manage and experience mentoring at work. Design/methodology/approach Semi-structured interviews with a cohort of 43 mentors and their mentees plus key informants were conducted. It is a longitudinal qualitative study undertaken with a year's cohort of mentors (referred to as devilmasters) and mentees (devils) in the profession of law, amongst Scottish barristers, advocates. Findings The meanings of mentoring differed widely between individuals. Mentoring relationships differed in their depth, quality and benefits the mentees received. The research findings reveal the inconsistencies and inequalities that are a fundamental part of the experience of mentoring that, as yet, the research literature has missed. The research also revealed how mentoring alone was not enough and that structured training was required to supplement mentoring. Further, there is a dependency to be found in mentoring. The mentoring process is power laden. Research limitations/implications Researchers may need to provide a definition of mentoring to those they research. Power needs to be fore-grounded in research. Originality/value As almost all previous research on mentoring is survey based, this is one of the few studies of the lived experience of mentoring, socialization and cognitive apprenticeship.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2021-0078;Green human resource management in nonprofit organizations: effects on employee green behavior and the role of perceived green organizational support. Purpose Building on the theories of social exchange and organizational support, this study proposes a research model to investigate the impact of green human resources management (GHRM) on nonprofit employees' green work-related outcomes, namely green voice behavior, green knowledge-sharing behavior and green helping behavior. In the model, perceived green organizational support (PGOS) is theorized and employed as an intervening mechanism between the examined linkages. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected in two different waves from 408 employees working in the Palestinian nonprofit sector. Covariance based-structural equation modeling was used to validate the study's research model and to examine the hypotheses. Findings The results indicated that GHRM is positively associated with green voice behavior, green knowledge-sharing behavior and green helping behavior. Moreover, the results show that PGOS exhibits a significant mediation effect between the aforesaid links. This study thus provides initial empirical evidence in the field of GHRM, with particular focus on the nonprofit sector. Research limitations/implications This research provides a roadmap to nonprofit managers and practitioners on how GHRM can encourage employees to speak up, share information and help others in the environmental and green domain. By supporting nonprofit managers strengthening green employee behavior, it provides an additional source to fostering intrinsically motivated behaviors in the workplace. Originality/value In response to urgent environmental threats, this study contributes to green and sustainable management research with a focus on GHRM, thereby providing initial empirical research from a nonprofit perspective.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2020-0403;Team reward interdependence and team performance: roles of shared leadership and psychological ownership. Purpose Drawing on social information processing theory, the purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between team reward interdependence and team performance, treating shared leadership as mediator and team average job-based psychological ownership as moderator. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from a field sample of 72 knowledge-based work teams comprised of 466 team members and their team leaders. Data were analysed using hierarchical regression analysis and moderated path analysis. Findings Team reward interdependence was positively related to team performance through shared leadership. Team average job-based psychological ownership moderated both the relationship between team reward interdependence and shared leadership, and the indirect relationship between team reward interdependence and team performance. Research limitations/implications The shared leadership literature is extended by exploring the antecedents of shared leadership from the perspective of team reward interdependence, and by examining the moderating role of team average job-based psychological ownership. Practical implications Organizations and managers should pay attention to team pay system design and be aware of the importance of employees' psychological ownership towards their jobs in promoting shared leadership in teams. Originality/value This study sheds light on the antecedents of shared leadership from the perspective of team incentives and examines antecedent boundary conditions through the moderating role of job-based psychological ownership.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2019-0172;Servant leadership and mistreatment at the workplace: mediation of trust and moderation of ethical climate. Purpose - With a foundation in social exchange theory, this study examines the relationship between servant leadership and three types of workplace mistreatment - bullying, incivility and ostracism - while also considering a mediating role of trust in the leader and a moderating role of the ethical climate.Design/methodology/approach - Three time-lagged sets of data (N = 431) were collected among employees working in various sectors.Findings - Servant leadership relates significantly to trust in the leader, as well as to workplace bullying, incivility and ostracism. In turn, trust in the leader mediates the relationship between servant leadership and all three types of workplace mistreatment. The results also indicate the presence of moderated mediation, in that the indirect effect of servant leadership on workplace mistreatment is moderated by the ethical climate.Originality/value - This study adds to extant research by examining the mediating mechanism of trust in leaders with servant leadership and workplace mistreatment, along with interactive effects of ethical climate.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-03-2020-0115;Does HRM's reality fit with those of others? Exploring and understanding HR attributions. Purpose The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the existing literature by providing insights about how employees make attributions about the reasons why management adopts HRM practices based on a case study of a company in Turkey. Design/methodology/approach The case study was carried out through semi-structured interviews with multiple employee groups aimed at capturing a broad range of perspectives. The data were processed by way of categorical and frequency analyses, which are forms of content analysis. Findings Non-managerial employees make similar attributions regarding recruitment and selection, training, performance as well as career development and benefits. Research limitations/implications Acknowledging different views regarding the changing nature of employees' attributions, qualitative longitudinal research would provide more rigorous analysis in terms of ascertaining whether there are any alterations in employees' attitudes towards HRM practices over time. Practical implications Management and practitioners can draw valuable insights from the fact that when the meanings attached to HR practices by different employee groups are agreed upon, this may lead to their more enthusiastic involvement with these practices. Originality/value This study examines employees' attributions regarding HR practices through a case study. It provides evidence that when employees ascribe positive meanings to such practices, they are more committed to them and this may promote more favourable outcomes regarding HR efforts.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2020-0095;Workforce age profile effects on job resources, work engagement and organizational citizenship behavior. Purpose The issue of age in organizations has become increasingly salient given expanding age profiles, from millennials to baby boomers. The purpose of this article is to improve the understanding of how age affects individuals' work-related attitudes and behaviors, the authors take a life span perspective to investigate how age profiles moderate the relationship between job resources and work engagement and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Design/methodology/approach The authors collected responses from 270 employees of multinational firms operating in India and conducted multiple regression analyses to examine the hypotheses. Findings The authors found that age profiles are significant predictors of work engagement. Specifically, the relationship between development opportunities and work engagement was stronger for younger employees than for older employees. However, age profiles were neither positively related to OCB nor a moderator of the job resources-OCB relationship. Originality/value The findings provide empirical evidence of the life span perspective, suggesting that age profiles influence work engagement. This is pertinent for organizations offering employees development opportunities to enhance work engagement.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22248;Relational incongruence in neurodiverse workgroups: Practices for cultivating autistic employee authenticity and belonging. Although much research has sought to understand how employees come to align themselves with the social norms and routines of their workgroups, management theory has largely overlooked the possibility that such alignment might be fundamentally at odds with what it means to be autistic. Autism, which accounts for a large share of organizational neurodiversity, is associated with seeing and processing the world differently from the non-autistic societal norm. In the workplace, autistic employees often experience barriers to inclusion, in large part due fundamental dissimilarities in how they interact with and connect to others. To identify the barriers to autistic employees' workgroup inclusion, we develop a multilevel framework centered around relational incongruence, or differences in patterns of interrelating across (autistic and non-autistic) neurotypes. We propose that non-autistic workgroup norms (e.g., for the use of imprecise language) exacerbate relational incongruence, which in turn hinders experiences of authenticity and belonging for the autistic workgroup member. Finally, we identify managerial practices (e.g., relational job crafting) that are likely to protect against the negative consequences of relational incongruence, by fostering workgroup climates of normalized variance in patterns of interrelating and shared understandings across neurotypes.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22241;Relational spirals and thriving: A longitudinal investigation of older workers. Thriving is believed to occur when employees feel a sense of progress and momentum in the organization. This conceptual basis for thriving is inherently temporal-implying an underlying individual change process-which sets thriving apart from other well-being criteria in the Human Resource Management literature. However, surprisingly little research has demonstrated and unpacked the change and development processes that lead to thriving. In this article, we develop and test a theoretical model of the dynamic origins of thriving in a socially important context: the aging workforce. Specifically, we propose that older workers thrive when they experience relational spirals: a deepening of the employee-organization relationship as psychological contracts and role expansion drive each other in a mutually reinforcing spiral. Results from a large-scale nationally representative longitudinal study of 3370 Australian older workers-spanning 1.5 years and three time points-support the proposed model. Older workers' relational psychological contracts and role expansion formed a mutually reinforcing spiral process over time which ultimately led to higher levels of thriving. These results held even after imposing autoregressive control of lagged variables at earlier time points, and after accounting for the contributions of transactional psychological contracts to the spiral process. Our theorizing and empirical approach brings dynamic processes to the forefront of HR research on thriving, and points to implications for the role of HR in successful aging.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22139;Employee behavior in employee stock option plans: Why do some employees acquire company stock?. The article focuses on decisions to exercise and hold company stock at the maturity of a broad-based employee stock options plan. It investigates why some participants choose an uncertain and risky future reward when an immediate and certain increase in wealth could be secured at exercise. It draws on and expands the mixed gambles perspective in behavioral agency theory, utilizing a combination of stock price data and employee survey data from British companies with tax-approved stock option plans. It is found that the decision to take a gamble is influenced (negatively) by the extent of stock price lows (relative to prices at exercise) in the year prior to exercise, and by the risk preferences of the option holder. The findings contribute to further development of the mixed gambles perspective as an explanation of stock option behavior, showing that individual characteristics as well as some stock price movements affect behavior.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22066;Does women's board representation affect non-managerial gender inequality?. Research examining gender and corporate boards has explored how women's representation impacts firm strategy and policy, particularly around corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues related to communities and other relevant stakeholders, the environment, and diversity and equity initiatives. However, fewer studies have examined how women's representation on boards affects gender inequality in firms. The studies that have been conducted generally focus on gender board diversity and the appointment of women executives. Yet, prior research has not sufficiently examined women's board representation and gender equality below executive level. Does women's representation have broader effects on gender equity beyond top leadership? And if so, is there a critical mass effect? In this article, we examine the relationship between women's board representation and non-managerial gender segregation. Gender segregation is an ideal measure of gender equality given that it captures the evenness of the distribution of women and men across jobs within workplaces and its well-known relationship to gender disparities in earnings and other job rewards. Drawing on Australian organization data (2014-2019) we find that the contemporaneous relationship between women's board representation and gender segregation is nonsignificant, but becomes significant and increases in magnitude with 1, 2, and 3-year lags. Our critical mass analysis suggests that having one woman on a board may not be enough to promote change but rather two or more women directors, or holding 20% or more board seats, appears to be more effective in reducing gender segregation. These findings demonstrate that the appointment of more women to corporate boards has broader effects on workplace gender equity beyond top leadership teams.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22243;Factors shaping the employment outcomes of neurodivergent and neurotypical people: Exploring the role of flexible and homeworking practices. Supporting neurodivergent-inclusive workplaces is an increasingly important consideration in Human Resource Management (HRM). While a strengths-based approach to neurodivergence has been advocated, empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of HRM practices that support high-quality employment outcomes for neurodivergent people is lacking. Drawing on a nationally representative sample of over 25,000 people in the United Kingdom, we examine the influence of neurodivergence on multiple employment outcomes, including employment status, underemployment, employment precarity, job tenure, and hourly wages. We theorize and empirically examine how flexible- and homeworking practices moderate the effects of neurodivergence on employment outcomes. Our findings show that neurodivergent people are twice as likely to be in precarious employment and more than 10 times as likely to be in temporary employment compared to neurotypical people. Neurodivergent individuals are also significantly more likely to experience underemployment and have lower employment tenure;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22190;The rise of the human capital industry and its implications for research. We document the size and scope of the industry of for-profit vendors that now handles a considerable proportion of human resource tasks for individual US employers, a collection we describe as the human capital industry. Outsourcing these tasks changes how the human resources function is executed in ways we describe below. This change should matter to researchers if they are interested in choosing topics that have relevance, and it should also matter to teachers of human resources who want to present an accurate description of practice to students. Aside from the now remarkable size of the HR industry, arguably its most important attribute is its marketing efforts, which now drive the agenda for the field of HR. A concern about that agenda is that it often creates the perception of challenges for management when in practice no evidence of those challenges exists.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22157;The adoption of human resource practices to support employees affected by intimate partner violence: Women representation in leadership matters. Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a global public health issue that negatively impacts organizations and their employees. Research suggests that organizations can play a supportive role to lessen this negative impact. However, it has been relatively silent on the conditions under which organizations choose to play such a role. Integrating social role and critical mass perspectives, we examine the extent to which organizations adopt human resource (HR) practices to support employees affected by IPV. Specifically, we argue that organizations are more likely to adopt IPV-related HR practices when they are led by female Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) and Top Management Teams (TMTs) with more female members. Furthermore, we argue that when women's representation reaches a critical mass plateau, appointing more women in TMTs has no incremental impact, and this non-linear relationship moderates the CEO gender effect. Overall, we found support for our hypotheses based on a survey study of HR professionals from 414 Australian organizations (Study 1) and an archival study using 2 years of the Workplace Gender Equality Agency data from 4186 Australian organizations (Study 2). Theoretical and practical implications on the influence of gender configurations in leadership positions on the adoption of diversity, equity, and inclusion-related HR practices are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22144;Social networks and citizenship behavior: The mediating effect of organizational identification. Are employees more likely to identify with their organization and engage in helping behaviors on its behalf if the coworkers who make up their social networks identify and help the organization? We draw on social information processing theory, social learning theory, and research on diffusion of innovation to develop a model that predicts how relational (advice ties) and structural (structural equivalence) factors predict organizational identification and organizational citizenship. We argue that OI is neither a matter of individual perceptions generated in isolation, nor a simple function of the number of ties that an employee has, but that it is instead an outcome of relations and interactions with coworkers, as reflected in the social structure of the employing organization. We tested our model by conducting a social network study of employees in a construction company. Our findings show that (1) employees tend to have similar levels of OI to the OI of their advice ties;art;" and (4) advice ties with high and moderate levels of OI are most strongly associated with similarity in OCB. In a supplementary analysis we show that the social influence model that we tested offers a better explanation for the role that the social context plays in shaping OI than does a more ties, more OI model. We discuss implications for theory and practice."",art";;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22114;Work transformation and the HR ecosystem dynamics: A longitudinal case study of HRM disruption in the era of the 4th industrial revolution. Disruption in human resource management (HRM) practices necessitates processes of mutual adjustment within the organization that seeks to address these changes properly, overcome tensions, and fit strategic needs. In our single longitudinal case study of a new HRM practice development concerning blue-collar worker talent management, we examine how HR professionals and managers interact and develop new HRM practices as a response to disruptive work transformation. Considering these interactions from the perspective of HR ecosystem alignment dynamics, we find that both managers and HR professionals engaged in fruitful collaboration processes along three differentiated steps to provide value for the whole organization. We propose a grounded theorizing of HR ecosystem alignment that is based on the progression of successive convergent and divergent phases and introducing collaborative spaces of work.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1108/PR-01-2024-0052;Unravelling the knowledge matrix: exploring knowledge-sharing behaviours on market-based platforms using regression tree analysis. Purpose - This study aims to enhance the effectiveness of knowledge markets and overall knowledge management (KM) practices within organisations. By addressing the challenge of internal knowledge stickiness, it seeks to demonstrate how machine learning and AI approaches, specifically a text-based AI method for personality assessment and regression trees for behavioural analysis, can automate and personalise knowledge market incentivisation mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach - The research employs a novel approach by integrating machine learning methodologies to overcome the limitations of traditional statistical methods. A natural language processing (NLP)-based AI tool is used to assess employees' personalities, and regression tree analysis is applied to predict and categorise behavioural patterns in knowledge-sharing contexts. This approach is designed to capture the complex interplay between individual personality traits and environmental factors, which traditional methods often fail to adequately address. Findings - Cognitive style was confirmed as a key predictor of knowledge-sharing, with extrinsic motivators outweighing intrinsic ones in market-based platforms. These findings underscore the significance of diverse combinations of environmental and individual factors in promoting knowledge sharing, offering key insights that can inform the automatic design of personalised interventions for community managers of such platforms. Originality/value - This research stands out as it is the first to empirically explore the interaction between the individual and the environment in shaping actual knowledge-sharing behaviours, using advanced methodologies. The increased automation in the process extends the practical contribution of this study, enabling a more efficient, automated assessment process, and thus making critical theoretical and practical advancements in understanding and enhancing knowledge-sharing behaviours.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-11-2023-0927;Disrupting human resource management with people analytics: a study of applications, value, enablers and barriers in Italy. PurposeThis research aims to explore whether or how organizations adopt people analytics (PA), its value and potential socio-technical factors that can enable or hinder PA projects by disrupting and reshaping human resource management. We do this by focusing on the Italian context.Design/methodology/approachWe conduct a scoping review of data collected between 2018 and 2022 via Google Alerts (GA), a content change detection and notification service that is gaining popularity in scholarly research.FindingsOur findings suggest that the diffusion of PA applications in Italy, especially those of a descriptive nature, is growing. Most of the existing PA applications are positioned in a positive technocratic light, envisioning the value of PA for both employees and organizations. The value for the latter appears to be direct, while the value for employees is realized through organizational initiatives. The findings also suggest that while enablers can vary between PA application types, the barriers, especially technological and environmental, are generic for both descriptive and predictive/prescriptive PA applications.Originality/valueTheoretically, we propose a framework for analyzing PA applications, their values, enablers and barriers. Methodologically, we present and describe in detail a novel approach, drawing on GA that can be used to study PA in specific contexts. Practically, our study serves as a helpful point of reference for managers planning or implementing PA in Italy, for benchmarking PA in Italy over time and for comparative international studies.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-08-2022-0537;Attachment, stress and interactional justice. PurposeThis paper aims to examine how individuals' attachment dispositions relate to interactional justice perceptions, how work stressors moderate this association, and how together they associate with attitudes (satisfaction, turnover intention, commitment) and citizenship behaviors at work.Design/methodology/approachSurvey data were used in an observed variable path analysis examining mediation by interactional justice and moderation by stressors on the associations between attachment dimensions and work outcomes.FindingsAttachment avoidance was negatively related to interactional justice perceptions and attachment anxiety was also negatively related to interactional justice perceptions, but only under conditions of higher work stressors. Interactional justice mediated the associations between attachment avoidance and work outcomes, and between the interaction of attachment anxiety and work stressors on work outcomes.Practical implicationsThese findings are particularly relevant to multiple aspects of HR practice, including performance feedback, managing stressors, building resilience, reward allocation and recognition, designing wellness programs and other aspects of human resource management.Originality/valueThis research goes beyond contextual predictors of justice perceptions and demonstrates that jointly considering attachment dimensions and work stressors uniquely contributes to understanding the formation of justice perceptions and their combined influence on work attitudes and behavior.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Purpose This study examines how team-level mediating mechanisms (i.e. team psychological safety and team helping behaviour) facilitate the relationship between employees' ingratiation and performance ratings. Design/methodology/approach The data were collected from 180 customer service teams working in Pakistan's hospitality industry through multiple sources using a paper and pencil questionnaire. Findings The multi-level structural equation modelling results showed that team psychological safety and helping behaviour fully mediated the relationship between ingratiation and performance ratings. Practical implications The study has offered some implications for theory and practices. Originality/value This study showed that ingratiation might be a helpful impression management tool within a team context. Such an influence technique nurtures a psychologically safe climate and encourages peers to help each other perform mutual tasks within the hospitality context.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Purpose Drawing upon the social exchange and psychological capital literature and applying a multilevel perspective, this paper examines how personal and organizational factors contribute to expatriates' adjustment and performance of international assignments in a terrorism-induced risky environment. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected using a non-probability sampling approach (e.g. purposive and subsequent snowball sampling). The authors tested the hypotheses using survey data of 138 expatriates with current international assignments in Pakistan. Findings Expatriates' perceived organizational and risk-taking propensity influences their performance through improved adjustment. Moderating effects suggest that an individual's satisfaction with the received organizational rewards strengthens the risk-taking propensity to adjustment relationship;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2021-0348;Does social distancing make the heart grow fonder? The impact of work spouse interaction frequency on organizational outcomes. Purpose The shift to remote work brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically limited spontaneous workplace interpersonal interactions. For one interpersonal relationship in particular, the work spouse, the sudden physical distance may impact the energy work spouses draw from one another. Drawing on interactional ritual theory, this study aims to investigate the relationship between interaction frequency and organizational outcomes mediated by relational energy amid the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach During the COVID-19 pandemic, working adults who indicated they had a work spouse were recruited via Qualtrics to participate in a two-part online study. Findings Complete data from 120 participants across both time periods revealed that more frequent interaction between work spouses is associated with increased job satisfaction and affective commitment mediated by relational energy. Originality/value This study represents the first empirical examination of individual and organizational outcomes of a unique interpersonal workplace relationship. Additionally, this study enhances our understanding of the impact of relational energy in socially distanced situations between employees in a close, intimate (non-sexual) pair bond.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-07-2020-0517;Entrepreneurial leadership and team creativity: the roles of team psychological safety and knowledge sharing. Purpose Creativity is vital for the innovation and survival of organizations. The present study aimed to explore the impact of entrepreneurial leadership on team creativity through team psychological safety and knowledge sharing. Social learning theory (SLT) was used to explore the relationships in this study. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from the manufacturing sector of Pakistan, and a sample composed of 70 team leaders and 378 team members was used. Findings The results showed the positive influence of entrepreneurial leadership on team creativity. Furthermore, team psychological safety and knowledge sharing mediated the relationship between entrepreneurial leadership and team creativity. Finally, team psychological safety and knowledge sharing sequentially mediated the relationship between entrepreneurial leadership and team creativity. Research limitations/implications A small sample size and cross-sectional research design may hinder the generalizability of the findings. The findings suggest that leaders should practice entrepreneurial leadership principles to develop team creativity. Organizations should provide training and development programmes for their leaders and employees to learn the importance of entrepreneurial behaviors and how to explore and exploit entrepreneurial opportunities. Originality/value This study extends the leadership and creativity literature by exploring the role of entrepreneurial leadership in developing team creativity. Furthermore, this study was conducted in established organizations to explore entrepreneurial leadership's influence on team creativity. In contrast, earlier scholars recognized entrepreneurial leadership as a leadership style of entrepreneurs and thus examined its implications in new ventures or small and medium enterprises.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2020-0326;Bullying and turnover intentions: how creative employees overcome perceptions of dysfunctional organizational politics. Purpose This study seeks to unpack the relationship between employees' exposure to workplace bullying and their turnover intentions, with a particular focus on the possible mediating role of perceived organizational politics and moderating role of creativity. Design/methodology/approach The hypotheses are tested with multi-source, multi-wave data collected from employees and their peers in various organizations. Findings Workplace bullying spurs turnover intentions because employees believe they operate in strongly politicized organizational environments. This mediating role of perceived organizational politics is mitigated to the extent that employees can draw from their creative skills though. Practical implications For managers, this study pinpoints a critical reason - employees perceive that they operate in an organizational climate that endorses dysfunctional politics - by which bullying behaviors stimulate desires to leave the organization. It also reveals how this process might be contained by spurring employees' creativity. Originality/value This study provides novel insights into the process that underlies the connection between workplace bullying and quitting intentions by revealing the hitherto overlooked roles of employees' beliefs about dysfunctional politics and their own creativity levels.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationships between the idealized influence component of transformational leadership (TL) and employee organizational commitment in two different cultural contexts. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from the members of two manufacturing organizations, one in Australia and one in Iran. Questionnaires were distributed to all levels of the two organizations. In total, 189 completed questionnaires were returned from the two countries, representing a response rate of 56.7%. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to test the hypotheses. Findings The results demonstrated statistically significant relationships between two forms of idealized influence -attributed and behavior - and the employees' organizational commitment in the Iranian sample. However, in the Australian sample, only idealized influence behavior showed a significant impact on employee commitment. Furthermore, the findings showed that identified motivation mediates the relationship between idealized influence behavior and organizational commitment. Practical implications The findings of the current research point to additional ways of increasing identified motivation that, in turn, enhances organizational commitment through leadership practices that are culturally informed. These findings are especially salient in culturally diverse and multinational organizations. Originality/value This paper has arrived at a deeper explanation of the processes through which leader behavior can produce employee commitment by clarifying the mediation role of identified motivation between idealized influence behavior and organizational commitment.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2019-0569;Organizational support and employee thriving at work: exploring the underlying mechanisms. Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether perceived organizational support for strength use (POSSU) predicts employee thriving at work and the underlying mechanisms that explain this relationship. Design/methodology/approach The analysis is based on data from an online, time-lagged survey of 209 employees. Latent moderated structural equations (LMS) method was used to test the mediating role of job crafting and meaningfulness and the moderating role of core self-evaluation (CSE) in the organizational support-employee thriving relationship. Findings POSSU has a direct, positive relationship with employee thriving at work. Moreover, this relationship is fully mediated by employees' job crafting (as an agentic work behavior) and meaningfulness (as a resource produced at work). In addition, contextual factor of POSSU synergistically interacts with individual characteristic of CSE to foster thriving at work. Research limitations/implications Based on a time-lagged survey, causal relationships cannot be drawn from this study. Results point to future research that can incorporate specific types of work climate and organizational practices in a multilevel design to investigate how context at team, unit and organizational levels impact employee thriving. Practical implications The study results highlight the importance of fostering employee thriving at work by implementing organizational practices that create supportive, innovative and meaningful workplaces. Management needs to pay close attention to develop a supportive organizational climate geared to identifying, developing and utilizing employees' strengths. Originality/value This study provides theoretical explanations and empirical tests on the mechanisms linking organization support and employee thriving based on the socially embedded model of thriving.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22209;Human resource executives' relative pay and firm performance. To operationalize the extent to which firms place a strategic emphasis on human capital and human resource management (HRM), we draw on the strategy field's dominant logic theory and on the emerging literature on executive compensation for the heads of major firm functions, such as HRM. Specifically, we investigate whether the pay of human resource executives (HREs) relative to other members of top management teams (TMTs) is related to firm performance. After controlling for the endogeneity of HRE status as one of the highest paid executives on the TMT, we find in a comprehensive sample of the largest US firms that HRE relative pay is positively related to firm financial performance, specifically Tobin's Q. We also find that the relationship of HRE relative pay with Tobin's Q is stronger in relatively smaller and younger firms in our sample. The findings suggest that a strategic emphasis on human capital and HRM leads to higher firm value.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22188;The scholarly impact of diversity research. This study contributes to the diversity literature by probing whether diversity papers are cited as frequently as nondiversity papers in management and industrial/organizational (I/O) psychology journals. Based on the stigma-by-association theory, I argue that as a result of their association with minority groups, diversity papers may be devalued and thus othered by scholars. Using a citation analysis of 46,930 papers published in 29 peer-reviewed management and I/O psychology journals, I present empirical evidence in Study 1 that diversity papers were cited significantly less frequently than nondiversity papers. The authors' gender and institutional prestige, journal tier and domain, and year of publication were not moderators. In Study 2, I used a scenario experiment to demonstrate the stigma-by-association effect. The authors' gender demonstrated a significant moderating effect in this experiment.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22185;Creation of the algorithmic management questionnaire: A six-phase scale development process. There is an increasing body of research on algorithmic management (AM), but the field lacks measurement tools to capture workers' experiences of this phenomenon. Based on existing literature, we developed and validated the algorithmic management questionnaire (AMQ) to measure the perceptions of workers regarding their level of exposure to AM. Across three samples (overall n = 1332 gig workers), we show the content, factorial, discriminant, convergent, and predictive validity of the scale. The final 20-item scale assesses workers' perceived level of exposure to algorithmic: monitoring, goal setting, scheduling, performance rating, and compensation. These dimensions formed a higher order construct assessing overall exposure to algorithmic management, which was found to be, as expected, negatively related to the work characteristics of job autonomy and job complexity and, indirectly, to work engagement. Supplementary analyses revealed that perceptions of exposure to AM reflect the objective presence of AM dimensions beyond individual variations in exposure. Overall, the results suggest the suitability of the AMQ to assess workers' perceived exposure to algorithmic management, which paves the way for further research on the impacts of these rapidly accelerating systems.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22180;How does human resource management balance exploration and exploitation? The differential effects of intellectual capital-enhancing HR practices on ambidexterity and firm innovation. After decades, dialogues on human resource management (HRM), intellectual capital (IC), and ambidexterity still continue, mirroring that the role of ambidextrous capability in translating the impact of HRM into superior performance remains unclarified. At this juncture, the current study proposes a novel theoretical framework to extend research on the relationship between IC-enhancing HR practices and innovation. It is done sophisticatedly by examining how firm exploitative and exploratory capabilities mediate the relationship between different combinations of HR configurations and firm innovation. To this end, we designed rigorous time-lagged research with three waves of data collection from the Iranian healthcare sector. Our analyses revealed that firm explorative and exploitative capabilities significantly mediate the relationship between human, social, and organizational capital-enhancing HR configurations and firm innovation. More conspicuously, by unraveling interaction patterns among distinct HR configurations, our study revealed the intricacies of the functioning of IC-enhancing HR practices in fueling firm ambidexterity. Hence, our study offers design options to navigate through exploitation and exploration in light of the firm's core innovation strategy. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings and suggest future research avenues.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22179;Getting from valid to useful: End user modifiability and human capital analytics implementation in selection. A major problem in employee selection coalesces around convincing decision-makers (e.g., hiring managers) to use analytically derived models. Existing recommendations in the literature largely focus on convincing executives to adopt analytical models and then exert their top-down influence on lower-level hiring decisions. In contrast to these solutions, we explore end user modifiability (i.e., allowing decision-makers to modify a statistical model before use) as a bottom-up approach for increasing hiring managers' implementation of analytical recommendations. From a utility standpoint, we consider how incorporating end user modifiability into hiring decisions will result in a less statistically valid, but potentially more valuable, organizational selection process. We explore these ideas in two studies. In Study 1, we experimentally test whether model modification increases decision-maker reliance on a statistical model, as well as how much decision-makers need to modify a model in order to use it. In Study 2, we examine the extent that modifiability introduces implicit biases that might adversely affect marginalized groups. Results suggest that modifiability can increase decision-makers' perceived usefulness of a model and, importantly, that only a small amount of modifiability is needed to elicit this effect. Further, end user modifications were statistically insignificant predictors of hiring rates across race-based subgroups, though supplementary analyses suggest important cautionary nuance. Given that analytical models are rarely perfectly or wholly implemented, end user modifiability may offer a viable solution for organizations seeking to increase the implementation of algorithmic guidance in selection decisions, even if it deviates modestly from a statistical optimality.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22149;A contingency approach to HRM and firm innovation: The role of national cultures. Companies adopt various HRM practices to enhance employees' abilities, motivations, and opportunities to foster innovation. Are these practices universally effective or culturally contingent? In this study, we draw on the Ability-Motivation-Opportunity (AMO) model and examine the effectiveness of three representative practices using a dataset of 304 companies from 13 countries or regions. We find that HRM practices need to fit in a supplementary/complementary way with national cultures to facilitate firm innovation: 1. cross-functional training (i.e., an ability-enhancing practice) is more effective in collectivistic rather than individualistic cultures (supplementary fit);art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1002/hrm.22132;Toward a non-organizational theory of human resource management? A complex adaptive systems perspective on the human resource management ecosystem in (con)temporary organizing. The emergence of the temporary organization has ushered in a new logic of organizing accompanied by paradigm-shifting challenges with respect to how the evolving nature of work, workers, and collective effort are to be understood. To capture the complexity inherent in this new order, and to broaden our focus from the organization to the enfolding ecosystem within which temporary organizing must be situated and understood, we engage in problematization to develop a multi-level framework for theorizing the contemporary human resource management ecosystem. Curating insights from complexity science, we conceptualize this ecosystem as a complex adaptive one and we propose a framework that integrates key structural (open boundaries and relational constitution), emergent (contextual and complex causality), and temporal (dynamic and adaptive) properties. To deepen lines of inquiry around these defining elements, we advance a series of propositions for testing, and we outline a range of theoretical, methodological, and practical implications that arise from our work.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22090;It takes two to tango: Knowledge transfer between expatriates and host country nationals. Integrating conservation of resource (COR) theory and the theory of relational organizing, we conceptualize expatriate-host country national (HCN) knowledge transfer as resource gains between the sender and receiver. Based on a sample of 107 expatriate-HCN dyads, we found that when the knowledge receiver, be it an expatriate or HCN, is high on cultural intelligence (CQ), the sender will be more likely to perceive higher levels of trust in the receiver and shared vision with the receiver. These cognitive responses to the receiver's CQ are instrumental in facilitating the receiver's knowledge acquisition. We also identified the sender's perceptions of the collaborative-based HR configuration as a contextual condition that strengthens the relationship between the knowledge receiver's CQ and the sender's perceived trust in the receiver and shared vision with the receiver.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22068;A meta-analysis on employee perceptions of human resource strength: Examining the mediating versus moderating hypotheses. Human resource (HR) strength research has substantially informed an understanding of the relationship between HR practices and employee-level outcomes. However, a key unresolved issue is whether employee perceptions of HR strength act as a mediator or a moderator in the relationship between HR practices and these outcomes. A meta-analysis of 42 studies (comprising 65 samples and 29,444 unique participants) was conducted to address this issue. Results support the mediating hypothesis for all five employee outcomes: employee reactions, proactive behavior, burnout, performance, and perceived organizational effectiveness. Conversely, the moderating hypothesis was only supported for employee performance. In addition, we examined five study characteristics (the operationalization of perceived HR strength, research study design, industry, sampling strategy, and publication status) as moderators. Using this analysis, we test the robustness of our main results and identify sources of heterogeneity in the results across studies. The results show that the mediating hypothesis still holds under different study designs and contexts. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22053;Organizational and comparative institutionalism in international HRM: Toward an integrative research agenda. Over the past two decades, a growing body of research on human resource management (HRM) has analyzed the relationship between international HRM and institutions. This work has primarily been informed by two leading streams of theory-organizational institutionalism and comparative institutionalism. However, these two dominant streams have seen much juxtaposition, but little logical integration. Moreover, scholars have paid little attention to the dynamics of contextualization (more specifically, institutional development and evolution), which limits the relevance of extant research. In this article, we review the extant literatures and their intellectual origins and develop an integrative research agenda that emphasizes the multilevel nature of HRM and evolution under external institutional change.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22269;Fraught Expectations: A Fairness Heuristic Process Model of the Pros and Cons of CSR for Talent Acquisition. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is purely an asset when it comes to talent acquisition: that is the dominant narrative among Human Resource Management (HRM) practitioners and scholars alike. Growing evidence, however, gives reason to question this assumption. Accordingly, in this conceptual paper, we develop a process model to articulate both the pros and cons of CSR for recruitment. Using fairness heuristic theory as a central organizing framework, we integrate three theoretical perspectives into the HRM and micro-CSR literatures. First, we leverage dual-processing attribution theory to propose that job seekers process information about CSR through both heuristic and deliberative processes, leading them to attribute employer CSR to substantive or symbolic motives. We explain how CSR attributions represent a fairness heuristic, meaning a proxy for how trustworthy job seekers appraise an employer to be. Second, invoking expectancy violation theory, we propose that the more job seekers attribute employer CSR to substantive (symbolic) motives, the higher (lower) their justice expectations will be, thereby increasing (decreasing) the consequences to employers for violating those expectations. Third, expanding scholarship on the dynamic nature of organizational fairness perceptions, we propose that job seekers update their attributions of employer CSR in a recursive cycle that can improve, but tends to degrade, as the recruitment process unfolds-particularly if they have high expectations to begin with. In so doing, we nudge the talent acquisition literature beyond static, fixed-in-time accounts to a more representative description of the dynamic and dual-sided role of CSR in recruitment over time.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22265;I'm Not Feeling It: The Role of Affective Diversity in Risk Management and Team Performance. Team performance is contingent on nuanced approaches to risk management-demanding both risky and cautious strategic orientations. However, research surrounding how teams navigate this balance is limited. We argue that both positive and negative affective diversity can aid team performance, through affective diversity's impact on the team's risky and cautious behaviors. Furthermore, we argue that team trait regulatory focus strengthens these relationships. Using a controlled laboratory setting with 58 teams in a complex, uncertain team task that requires both risky and cautious strategies for successful performance, results indicate that positive affective diversity relates to team performance through promoting risky behavior, while negative affective diversity relates to team performance through promoting cautious behavior. Teams high in trait prevention-focus are more attuned to the information signals in teams with negative affective diversity, but we did not find that promotion focus impacted outcomes of positive affective diversity.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22264;Who am I? Exploring Temporary workers' Integration in Multi-Employment-Type Organizations From the Identity Threat Perspective. This study aims to advance current understanding concerning situational cues that trigger identity threat at the workplace among temporary workers and associated effects on their integration outcomes in the flexible employment scenario. We used the social identity threat theory to empirically investigate the impact of the extent to which regular employees' job conditions are superior to those of temporary workers on these workers' outcomes, through the identity threat. In addition, we examined the moderating role of organizations' social integration practices. We conducted two empirical studies involving technical temporary workers in Chinese companies, in which we used polynomial regression analyses and response surface modeling. In Study 1, using a two-wave time-lagged design, we analyzed data from 480 temporary workers, and in Study 2, using a three-wave time-lagged multi-source dyadic design, we analyzed matching data from 371 temporary workers and 64 supervisors. Our findings indicate that the extent to which regular employees' job conditions surpass those of temporary workers is positively associated with identity threat among the latter, increasing their turnover intention and undermining their job performance. Moreover, temporary workers' perceptions of their organizations' social integration practices weaken the effects of the extent to which regular employees' job conditions surpass those of temporary workers. Thus, this study contributes to related literature on social identity threat and temporary workers, and to practice, by offering offers insightful implications for managers to effectively manage this threat.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22236;Toward a better understanding of self-regulation promoting interventions: When performance management and job crafting meet. Organizations utilize self-regulation promoting interventions to empower employees in managing challenges and resources autonomously. However, there is limited understanding of how these interventions impact employee task performance and innovative behavior, as well as which processes are critical for their effectiveness. Therefore, a field experiment was conducted to examine the effects of two self-regulation promoting interventions-the Productivity Measurement and Enhancement Systems intervention (ProMES), a job crafting intervention, and their combination-on individual employee performance and innovation through selected process variables. We collected data before, during, and after the interventions over 16 weeks among 123 employees across three experimental and one control group. Consistent with predictions, participants of the ProMES intervention reported a higher level of perceived team climate, which consequently contributed to greater individual innovative behavior. Participants in the job crafting intervention exhibited an increase in job crafting behaviors, which consequently increased innovative behavior and task performance. Unexpectedly, the combined intervention yielded negative effects on both innovative behavior and task performance. The findings suggest that while self-regulation promoting interventions increase favorable outcomes through different mechanisms their combination may impair relevant processes and, more generally, overwhelm employees.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22223;Covert allyship: Implementing LGBT policies in an adversarial context. This study introduces the concept of covert allyship as a strategy for tacitly supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) inclusion in adversarial contexts. Drawing on a qualitative case study of 12 Western multinational enterprises (MNEs) operating in Indonesia, the largest Muslim country in the world, the article sheds light on how allyship for LGBT issues is undertaken covertly as allies seek to transcend tensions arising between headquarters publicly advocating for LGBT rights and their subsidiaries. The findings evaluate both barriers to MNE subsidiaries implementing LGBT-supportive policies and facilitating mechanisms for covert forms of institutional allyship. Finally, the article provides recommendations for how MNEs can adopt practices that build subtle yet effective LGBT-supportive approaches in contexts that require sensitivity to local cultures and legislation.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22216;How does Human Resource Management help service organizations to thrive in uncertainties and risks: Postcrisis as a context. With heightened uncertainties and risks in the fluctuating business environment, existing studies have concentrated on elucidating how service organizations leverage human resource practices to adapt to and survive such unforeseen and disruptive threats. However, how such practices could serve the strategic objective of cultivating a sustainably thriving workforce across different situations is not well understood. Thriving is a core transitional state that fosters positive behaviors, such as creative customer-related problem-solving. Applying social information processing theory, we propose and test a model by exploring how organizations that engage in thriving-oriented human resource management (HRM) encourage employees to take responsibility and promote constructive change, thereby activating their creative problem-solving behaviors. Specifically, we theorize and develop measures to promote thriving-oriented HRM in Study 1. In Study 2, we collected multisource and multi-wave data from 296 frontline service employees and 45 supervisors in China. Our findings reveal that thriving-oriented HRM is positively related to felt responsibility for change, which ultimately encourages creative problem-solving. We also show that the threat imposed by a crisis, that is, the COVID-19 pandemic, strengthens the positive relationship between thriving-oriented HRM and felt responsibility for change. Our study contributes to the HRM literature, especially on thriving-oriented HRM and employee perception, and has practical implications for service organizations in the uncertain context.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22133;Employee experience -the missing link for engaging employees: Insights from an MNE's AI-based HR ecosystem. Analyzing multiple data sources from a global information technology (IT) consulting multinational enterprise (MNE), this research unpacks the configuration of a digitalized HR ecosystem of artificial intelligence(AI)-assisted human resource management (HRM) applications and HR platforms. This study develops a novel theoretical framework mapping the nature and purpose of a digitalized AI-assisted HR ecosystem for delivering exceptional employee experience (EX), an antecedent to employee engagement (EE). Employing the theoretical lenses of EX, EE, AI-mediated social exchange, and engagement platforms, this study's overarching aim of this article is to establish how AI-assisted HRM fits into an organization's ecosystem and, second, how it impacts EX and EE. Our findings show that AI-assisted applications for HRM enhance EX and, thus, EE. We also see increases in employee productivity and HR function's effectiveness. Implications for research and practice are also discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22100;Global talent management and multinational subsidiaries' resilience in the Covid-19 crisis: Moderating roles of regional headquarters' support and headquarters-subsidiary friction. Resilience is central to developing organizational capability to respond to global crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic. To date, few studies have examined the relationship between global talent management (GTM) and the organizational resilience of multinational enterprise (MNE) subsidiaries during crises. This study contributes to the GTM and crisis management literature by examining the role of GTM in MNE subsidiaries' resilience during the Covid-19 crisis. Based on the sample of 166 Korean MNEs and their 1227 foreign subsidiaries, including 293 regional headquarters, operating in 49 host countries, this study shows a positive and significant impact of GTM on the resilience of Korean MNEs subsidiaries. Drawing on agency problems at the subsidiary level and bounded rationality at the headquarters level as factors that may bring about failure in TM in MNEs, as well as a core competence perspective, we shed light on the importance of the three-layered governance structure of MNEs in the analysis of GTM and MNE subsidiaries' resilience. The study has practical implications for Korean MNEs and the organizational resilience of MNEs' subsidiaries during crises more generally.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22092;The dynamics of diplomatic careers: The shift from traditional to contemporary careers. Career research has focused on the changing structures of careers, mainly in the private sector. Recent literature on employment patterns in the public sector suggests that career structures are evolving, gradually moving away from their signature traditional structures to contemporary ones. However, empirical evidence of this change is scarce and inconclusive. This qualitative study examines the changes currently unfolding in the career structure of the civil service by eliciting the experiences and views of senior Foreign Offices (FOs) staff in four countries: 198 state ambassadors from the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, and Denmark were interviewed about their career trajectories. The data were analyzed using a thematic analysis framework. The findings revealed a gradual breakdown of the structures and policies that support traditional careers, and the emergence of new principles and practices that characterize contemporary careers. However, as they were captured midway through the process of change, all FOs display a combination of traditional and contemporary career structures at this point. The findings offer unique insights into the drivers of this evolution and highlight some of the consequences.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In recent times, leading information technology (IT) multinational enterprises claim to have abandoned many traditional features of their performance management systems (PMSs), including the bell curve. However, there is no published empirical study on how employees are perceiving the change.

Employees perceived the present purposes of PMS marginally more favorably than those in the past;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22225;Dare to thrive! How and when do development idiosyncratic deals promote individual thriving at work?. Despite the importance of a thriving workforce in sustaining organizational success, prior research pays little attention to how individualized human resource (HR) practices can help individual employees to thrive at work. Drawing on the theoretical underpinnings of conservation of resources theory, we investigate whether, how, and when development idiosyncratic deals (i-deals) can contribute to individual thriving. We contend that possessing development i-deals will motivate individuals to engage in approach job crafting, which in turn promotes their experience of thriving at work. We further contend that high-quality leader-member exchange will enhance the function of development i-deals in triggering approach job crafting and subsequent thriving experiences. Results from a two-wave survey involving 278 managers in a pharmaceutical firm in China and a three-wave survey among 178 managers working in various organizations in the UK support our hypotheses. Our findings provide new insights for practitioners seeking to design customized HR practices to support a thriving workforce.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22189;Answerable for what? The role of accountability focus in line manager HR implementation. Line managers are often responsible for implementing HR practices in organizations. Why do some line managers implement HR practices as intended while others do not? We draw on the concept of accountability focus to highlight that managers' HR implementation behavior is driven by what they feel accountable for, and we examine how accountability focus is shaped by characteristics of managers' role. We test our theoretical model across two field studies: a three-wave survey with managers and a study with dyads of managers and employees. When managers experienced more autonomy in their HR role, they felt more accountable for outcomes and were less likely to implement HR practices, but this was mitigated when managers also felt competent in their HR responsibilities. More competent managers felt more accountable for processes and in turn were more likely to implement HR practices, which positively related to employees' discretionary effort. Our findings highlight boundaries to managerial autonomy, and theoretical insights about the motivational mechanisms, which drive HR implementation, with implications for employees. We contribute to theory on managerial accountability by elaborating the nomological net of accountability focus and, by developing a measurement scale through several pilot studies, provide opportunities for further research.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22082;How workplace support for the COVID-19 pandemic and personality traits affect changes in employees' affective commitment to the organization and job-related well-being. How do organizational responses to environmental disruptions affect employees' job-related well-being? As the COVID-19 pandemic has led to new ways of working, increased health concerns, and added responsibilities, employees are facing important challenges in doing their work that can affect their job-related well-being. This study aims to understand how different types of work support (i.e., perceived organizational support and supervisor accessibility) in response to environmental disruption interact with personality traits (i.e., core self-evaluations and future focus) to influence changes in employees' affective commitment to their organization and in their job-related well-being. We develop a moderated mediation model and test it on data collected from 295 individuals working in the United Kingdom. We find that work support for the COVID-19 pandemic, both perceived organizational support and supervisor accessibility, is associated with more positive changes in employees' job-related well-being and that this effect is mediated by changes in employees' affective commitment to their organization. Furthermore, we find that personality traits moderate the relationships between these two types of support and changes in affective commitment to the organization, with those relationships being more positive for employees with low core self-evaluations and for those with a high future focus.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22065;One way or another? An international comparison of expatriate performance management in multinational companies. Due to the high costs and strategic importance of expatriate assignments, expatriate performance management (EPM) plays an increasingly important role for multinational enterprises (MNEs). However, research on EPM is still in its infancy. Drawing from the convergence/divergence debate in international human resource management, this study investigates and compares EPM strategies and practices across MNEs from three different country clusters to better understand whether EPM practices tend to converge, diverge, or crossverge (i.e., show aspects of both). Results from surveying 132 Anglo-Saxon, Germanic, and Japanese MNEs reveal prominent differences (divergence) at the EPM strategic level such that Japanese MNEs tend to pursue more ethnocentric staffing strategies and design EPM systems specifically tailored to expatriates. On the practice level, we found both commonalities and differences between Japanese and Anglo-Saxon and Germanic MNEs, pointing toward crossvergence. Theoretical and practical implications of our results are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22055;A vicious cycle of symbolic tokenism: The gendered effects of external board memberships on chief executive officer compensation. Integrating theoretical perspectives on tokenism and perceived preferential selection, we explore whether the relationship between chief executive officers' (CEOs') external board memberships and CEO compensation is gendered. Based on recent pressures to diversify corporate boards, we theorize that female CEOs' memberships on external boards will result in less monetary compensation relative to male CEOs due to concerns of organizational decision-makers that female CEOs generally inhabit token or symbolic positions of limited value. Additionally, we present competing hypotheses (i.e., mitigation vs. exacerbation) regarding how this devaluation will be affected by female representation on the board of directors and compensation committee, respectively. Using a panel sample of 12,464 firm-year observations comprising of 1,805 unique firms and 2,782 unique CEOs, the relationship between CEO external board memberships and compensation is indeed weaker for female compared to male CEOs. Furthermore, this devaluation primarily occurred in organizations where there was stronger (vs. weaker) female representation on the board of directors or compensation committee. However, supplemental analyses revealed that this differential devaluation was mitigated when female executives on the board held greater power (i.e., chaired important committees), highlighting the importance of moving beyond mere representation to ensuring influence on boards for female directors.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2024-0082;Social mobility as a driver of employee silence in India: toward a contextualized understanding of silence in emerging markets. PurposeThis paper aims to explore how the context in a dynamically developing country affects employee silence in India.Design/methodology/approachQualitative design involving semi-structured interviews with employees and managers from different sectors in the Mumbai and Delhi areas. An abductive approach was used to analyze the data.FindingsTwo types of social mobility concerns - advancement aspiration and fear of social decline - emerged as salient drivers of silence and can be attributed to a volatile job market, social status markers, transferability of qualification, someone's socio-economic situation and the overall economic situation. Pathways were specified from social mobility concerns to silence tendencies that are motivated by both low approach and high avoidance.Research limitations/implicationsSocial mobility as a specific factor in the Indian distal context and as a characteristic of emerging markets can motivate silence while organization-related concepts like job satisfaction or commitment may have less predictive value. Propositions that were derived from the interview study need to be validated by deductive research. Generalizability of Indian findings across other emergent markets needs to be shown.Originality/valueTo the organizational behavior (OB) scholarship on silence, this research contributes by identifying antecedents of silence that are situated beyond the organizational boundaries challenging the dominant role of established factors at the team- and organizational level. To the human resource management/employment relations (HRM/ER) scholarship, this research contributes by theorizing psychological processes that link environmental factors to silence behaviors.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-03-2023-0206;Job design in blue- and white-collar jobs: the influence of transformational leadership on job crafting and i-deals. PurposeWhereas job crafting and idiosyncratic deals (i-deals) have primarily been studied in white-collar jobs, there is a lack of research on job design in less skilled and highly structured work. Our study addresses this gap by analyzing the effects of transformational leadership on job crafting and i-deals in blue- and white-collar jobs.Design/methodology/approachTo test our hypotheses, we surveyed 285 employees (31.9% blue-collar employees and 68.1% white-collar employees) in the German craft industry, using structural equation modeling for data analysis.FindingsOur results show that transformational leadership is a strong predictor of job crafting and i-deals but that its influence depends on the occupational group. More specifically, the moderating role of the occupational group in the relationship between transformational leadership and job crafting differs regarding job crafting's dimensions. Concerning i-deals, transformational leadership's influence on both development and task i-deals is stronger in white-collar jobs than it is in blue-collar jobs.Practical implicationsThe study provides new insights into the important role of the work context in which leadership takes place. In particular, these insights can guide leaders in how to manage different occupational groups to engage them in proactive behaviors.Originality/valueThis study is the first to compare the contextual roles of blue- and white-collar jobs with regard to job design. By examining the influence of transformational leadership on job crafting and i-deals in two occupational groups, our study contributes to research on the role of work context in the effectiveness of transformational leadership in encouraging employees to engage in proactive behaviors.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The author categorised these employee competencies as cognitive (cognitive flexibility, agility mindset and personal ambidexterity), cross-cultural (cross-cultural intelligence and cross-cultural collaboration), analytical (creativity and complex problem solving) and personal effectiveness competencies (personal resilience, continuous learning and adaptive mindset).Practical implicationsThe proposed competencies could be used for the personal development of employees and organisations. The VUCA competency framework developed in this study includes behavioural dimensions for each competency, which could be used in self-assessment, recruitment and selection and talent and performance management. Furthermore, the author proposes L&D interventions required for developing these competencies. Overall, this study contributes to human resources (HR) development in the VUCA era by proposing the development of specific individual competencies as necessary conditions for survival and growth.Originality/valueVUCA competencies empower employees to not only survive but also thrive in an unpredictable and rapidly changing world. By incorporating these competencies in L&D interventions, organisations can help employees develop the necessary competencies to thrive in a VUCA environment, thus contributing to their personal and organisational success.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-09-2021-0673;Work interrupted at home: examining the influence of supportive teleworking practices on work-family conflict. PurposeBy utilizing boundary theory and distraction-conflict theory, this study attempted to examine the influential process of supportive teleworking practices granting work scheduling autonomy on work-to-family conflict (WFC) via the mediating mechanism of work interruption initiated from home.Design/methodology/approachThe study conducted two-wave online questionnaire survey to obtain a final sample of 277 remote knowledge workers in Taiwan during the peak period of COVID-19 pandemic. Hypotheses were tested with partial least squares-structural equation modelling using SmartPLS 3.0 software.FindingsThe results revealed that supportive teleworking practices did not directly decrease the level of WFC while home-sourced work interruptions fully mediated the negative relationship between supportive teleworking practices and WFC.Originality/valueThis provides a more nuanced explanation for how and why supportive teleworking practices are beneficial for employees to cope with the challenge of work-home interferences under the new ways of working. The findings simultaneously address evidence-based practices to better deal with mandatory teleworking during potential societal crisis beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2023-0122;Quiet quitting: a new wine in an old bottle?. PurposeJust as the Covid-19 pandemic has hit all areas of life, it has also hit the working life. Towards the end of the pandemic period, the concept of quiet quitting entered people's lives. The phenomenon of quiet quitting has been introduced as a brand new concept in the mainstream media and social media in general. The primary objective of this study is to investigate and define the emerging phenomenon of quiet quitting. Furthermore, this study aims to compare this novel phenomenon with other established theoretical approaches in the field of management.Design/methodology/approachThis review study specifically examines the concept of quiet quitting, aiming to gain a deeper understanding of this phenomenon.FindingsContrary to popular belief, the phenomenon of quiet quitting is not a recent or trendy occurrence. Instead, it has persisted for numerous years and is intertwined with various theories such as motivation, commitment, engagement and social exchange theory.Practical implicationsThis study provides employers, managers, HR practitioners with recommendations on how to address the employee's quiet quitting behavior.Originality/valueThis study represents a pioneering work that explores an uncharted territory, the phenomenon of quiet quitting. The authors demonstrated and relate the historical processes of management theories to the phenomenon of quiet quitting, which is a concept that appears to lack roots.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2021-0239;Green human resource management and employee innovative behaviour: does inclusive leadership play a role?. PurposeThis study examines the relationship between green human resource management (green HRM) and employee innovative behaviour. It also investigates the mediating role of job satisfaction to explore the mechanism through which green HRM is related to employee innovative behaviour. Additionally, it examines the moderating role of inclusive leadership to determine the boundary condition of the relationship between green HRM and employee innovative behaviour.Design/methodology/approachThe study used a quantitative research approach using survey and collected 508 responses from full-time employees in Australia.FindingsThe authors have found support for all the hypothesised relationships in the study. Specifically, green HRM is positively related to employee innovative behaviour. This relationship is mediated by job satisfaction and accentuated by inclusive leadership.Originality/valueGreen HRM promotes a green atmosphere in which employees can contribute to a safer and healthier environment. Despite the increasing attention to green HRM in the management literature, little is known about the mechanisms and boundary conditions explaining employees' responses to green HRM.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2020-0354;Impact of internal corporate social responsibility: a parallel mediation analysis. Purpose Workplace deviant behaviors (WDBs) have a significant negative impact on firms. Present study explores the role of employees' perception of firms' internal corporate social responsibility (internal CSR) in reducing their intention to engage in WDB. Social exchange theory (SET) and job demand-resource (JD-R) model form the conceptual underpinning of the study. Design/methodology/approach Hypotheses were developed based on a comprehensive literature review and tested on employees working in various public and private sector organizations in India. AMOS and SPSS PROCESS macro were used to test the conceptual model. Findings Employees' perception of firms' internal CSR reduced their intention to engage in WDB. Occupational strain was confirmed as a mediator in the above mentioned relationship. Further, the study also establishes internal CSR as an antecedent to increased perceptions of procedural justice. Practical implications Managers may leverage internal CSR communication as a tool to minimize WDB at the workplace. Moreover, it may also be used to reduce occupational strain and strengthen the perceptions of fairness among employees. Originality/value Very limited research is available on internal CSR and WDB. Through this study authors contribute to the nascent literature by affirming the negative relationship between internal CSR and WDB using the SET and JD-R model.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2021-0774;Helping as an opportunity and risk: an alternative side to gratitude in co-worker dyads. Purpose As workplaces and relationships evolve with increasing complexity, co-worker dynamics have become a key concern for HR managers and scholars. An important yet overlooked aspect of co-worker dynamics is gratitude. This paper adopts a relationship-specific conceptualization of gratitude and explores its influence on prosocial behaviors within co-worker dyads. The proposed model also suggests structural-relational factors under which these relationships are affected. Design/methodology/approach The conceptual paper draws insights from personal relationships to consider an alternative side of gratitude's prosocial action tendencies, thereby highlighting two: risk-oriented and opportunity-oriented. These assumptions are then situated within the affect theory of social exchange to predict gratitude's influence on prosocial behaviors within co-worker dyads. Findings The proposed model illuminates the importance of studying relationship-specific gratitude within co-worker relations by illustrating its effects on two types of prosocial action tendencies - opportunity-oriented and risk-oriented and varying prosocial behaviors (from convergent to divergent). Structural-relational factors, such as positional and physical distance between co-workers, are considered to affect these relationships. Originality/value While the study of gratitude in the workplace is emerging, little research has examined its influence on the nature of prosocial behaviors within co-worker relations. This paper advances the notion that gratitude serves an adaptive function in co-worker dyads, thereby highlighting the risk-oriented and opportunity-oriented continuum, and its implications for the type and scope of prosocial behaviors exchanged.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2021-0709;Impact of workplace safety on well-being: the mediating role of thriving at work. Purpose Based on the socially embedded model of thriving at work and using the conservation of resources and job demands-resources theories, this study aims to examine the mediating role of thriving at work, as a personal resource, in the relationship between workplace safety, as job resource, and well-being. Design/methodology/approach The authors used structural equation modeling to test the mediation model on a sample of 350 correctional officers. Findings The results provided support to the authors' model. The authors found that workplace safety is positively linked to job satisfaction and negatively to health complaints, and these relationships are partially mediated by thriving at work. Consistent with the conservation of resources theory, thriving at the workplace is a mechanism that translates the positive effect of workplace safety on well-being. Originality/value The contribution of this research resides that a safe work environment leads to improved health and job satisfaction via thriving at work because thriving correctional officers feel energetic and able to acquire and apply knowledge and skills at workplace.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-08-2021-0573;You're so good-looking and wise, my powerful leaders! When deference becomes flattery in employee-authority relations. Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between employees' deference to leaders' authority and their upward ingratiatory behavior, which may be invigorated by two personal resources (dispositional greed and social cynicism) and two organizational resources (informational justice and forgiveness climate). Design/methodology/approach In this study survey data were collected among employees who work in the banking sector. Findings Strict adherence to leaders' authority stimulates upward ingratiatory behavior, especially when employees (1) have a natural tendency to want more, (2) are cynical about people in power, (3) believe they have access to pertinent organizational information and (4) perceive their organization as forgiving of mistakes. Practical implications For human resource (HR) managers, this study points to the risk that employees' willingness to comply blindly with the wishes of organizational leaders can escalate into excessive, inefficient levels of flattery. Several personal and organizational conditions make this risk particularly likely to materialize. Originality/value This study extends prior human resource management (HRM) research by revealing the conditional effects of an unexplored determinant of upward ingratiatory behavior, namely, an individual desire to obey organizational authorities unconditionally.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-08-2021-0585;Exhausted by social distancing at work: understanding the effects of COVID-19 pandemic in workgroups. Purpose In the new post-COVID-19 work order, this study aims to examine whether and how individual-level social distancing interacts with workgroup-level socio-affective support to influence employee exhaustion and performance. Design/methodology/approach Multi-level analyses of time-lagged multi-source data from 231 employees nested in 34 workgroups were conducted to test our hypothesized relationships. Findings Analyses revealed a significant relationship between social distancing and employee performance via emotional exhaustion. Further, the positive relationship between social distancing and emotional exhaustion was attenuated by workgroup team orientation and support for innovation, and the indirect effect of social distancing on employee performance was weaker in workgroups with a high team orientation and high support for innovation. Originality/value This study extends the job demands-resources theory to the new work order and examines the impact of workplace social distancing on employee outcomes in the context of workgroup membership.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2021-0032;Insider perspectives on director remuneration governance deliberations. Purpose Companies around the globe increasingly receive immense shareholder scrutiny due to perceivably excessive executive director remuneration. The debate in South Africa intensifies due to severe pay inequality. The authors thus accounted for the perspectives of asset managers and listed financial services companies in South Africa pertaining to the impact of voting and engagement on director pay policies and practices. Design/methodology/approach Semi-structured interviews were conducted with selected asset managers, chief executive officers, chief financial officers and remuneration committee members of listed financial services companies to gauge their views on the impact of shareholder activism endeavours on remuneration governance. The qualitative data was analysed by conducting thematic analysis. Findings Most of the asset managers and financial services representatives preferred proactive, private engagement on pay concerns, given the impact thereof on voting outcomes, and ultimately director remuneration practices and policies. Independent remuneration committees have a prominent role in facilitating engagements with investors to ensure fair remuneration. Research limitations/implications The consequences should be clearer if organisations receive substantial votes against their pay policies and implementation reports. South African regulators can consider the two-strikes rule to ensure that action is taken in response to shareholder voting on director remuneration matters. Originality/value Representatives of asset managers and listed financial services investee companies offered valuable insights on remuneration governance deliberations in an emerging market. This in-depth analysis highlights the importance of proactive engagement to ensure that corporate leaders are paid fairly.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-03-2021-0212;Understanding the role of job quality in the association of employees' career change to self-employment and job satisfaction. Purpose - While researchers have discussed the association between career change to self-employment and job satisfaction, few have considered how the association is achieved. Therefore, in this study, the authors aim to explain this relationship from the perspective of job quality. The authors build on job design theory to propose and empirically test how fluctuations in job satisfaction as associated with the transition to self-employment can be explained by changes in job quality. Design/methodology/approach - The authors tested their propositions using a longitudinal, nationally representative database from Australia for the 2005-2019 period. The final sample included 108,384 observations from 18,755 employees. Findings - In line with the literature, the authors found that job incumbents experienced low job satisfaction in the years prior to their career change to self-employment and that their job satisfaction improved after the transition. More importantly, the authors found the same change pattern for job quality - measured as job autonomy and skill variety - and the statistical results demonstrated that job quality was the key determinant of job satisfaction during the process. Practical implications - This study advocates the importance of job quality in managing employee wellbeing and facilitating retention. Originality/value - The authors contribute to the literature by uncovering how job quality, represented by skill variety and job autonomy, can explain fluctuations in job satisfaction during individuals' career change from paid employment to self-employment.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2021-0469;Neurodiversity and remote work in times of crisis: lessons for HR. Purpose The rich qualitative study builds on 11 semi-structured interviews with nine neurodivergent employees and two business professionals supportive of neurodiversity to understand the lived experiences of dealing with crisis in a remote working environment. Design/methodology/approach The purpose of the reported research is to understand how neurominorities experience remote working in the times of crisis and what the implications of this are for human resource (HR) professionals. Findings Moving to remote work resulted in a lack of routine, distractions and working long hours, which can all be difficult for line managers to monitor. Further problems with communication in a virtual environment and lack of understanding by others were found to be particularly burdensome to neurodivergent individuals. On the positive note, remote working in the times of crisis allowed for avoiding sensory overwhelm and was seen as an important step in creating a healthy work-life balance (WLB). Practical implications The findings of this study point HR practitioners' attention towards building a more neurodiversity friendly post-pandemic workplace and prompt employers to offer working arrangements, which better suit employees' domestic and personal circumstances. Originality/value This study addresses the lack of research on the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on neurominorities. In doing so, it answers recent calls to move away from universal HR as a route to positive employee outcomes and facilitates a more accurate reflection of organizational reality for disadvantaged members of society.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2021-0109;A multilevel model of abusive supervision climate. Purpose Abusive supervision climate (ASC) affects not only direct subordinates of abusive supervisors but also their colleagues who work in the same group. Therefore, this study aims to examine the underlying processes and boundary conditions of ASC's effects on group members' behaviors. Design/methodology/approach The study collected data from 213 employees in 51 workgroups across 13 organizations in Pakistan. Data were analyzed in MPlus version 8 (Muthen and Muthen, 1998-2017) using a random intercepts multilevel model. The authors followed the procedures for testing 2-1-1 mediation with a participant-level mediator as outlined in Pituch and Stapleton (2012). Findings The results revealed that anger mediated the negative relationship between ASC and group members' organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs), as well as the positive relationship between ASC and group members' withdrawal. In addition, agreeableness moderated the effect of group members' anger on OCBs, such that the relationship was stronger for more agreeable group members. Originality/value The findings contribute to the abusive supervision literature by elucidating anger as one mechanism through which ASC affects group members and by incorporating personality differences to better understand group members' behavioral responses.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1108/PR-08-2023-0685;The role of family support on the effects of paramedic role overload on resilience, intention to leave and promotive voice. PurposeParamedics have played a critical role in the health care system response to the COVID-19 pandemic as frontline responders. However, in comparison to other health care workers (i.e. nurses), less research has been conducted on how paramedic work has been undertaken and how they manage their resources in the context of high workloads. This study examines several factors that deplete paramedic resources as well as the importance of family support in buffering the effects of low levels of resilience that can impact paramedic intention to leave and promotive voice.Design/methodology/approachData were collected from 648 paramedics employed by Ambulance Victoria, Australia, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We examine five hypotheses: (1) resilience mediates the relationship between role overload and intention to leave;art;" (4) family support moderates the indirect effect of role overload on intention to leave via resilience and (5) family support moderates the indirect effect of role overload on promotive voice via resilience.FindingsWe found that when family support was low, the impact of role overload on turnover intention via resilience was significant. When family support was low, the negative impact of role overload on promotive voice via resilience was significant. When family support was high, such a negative indirect effect was not significant in predicting employee promotive voice via resilience.Practical implicationsWe suggest that organisations should focus human resource management (HRM) policies and practices on family-friendly initiatives to further enhance family support resources to benefit individuals, families and organisations.Originality/valueOur findings demonstrate the importance of family support as a buffer to the negative effects of role overload on employee resilience and promotive voice. There is clear importance of the contextual elements of family support as a resource, and its absence may result in resource depletion and can act as a catalyst in a resource depletion spiral. This demonstrates the importance of organisations understanding and learning to utilise external resources to complement organisational and individual resources to reduce intention to leave and support promotive employee voice. We suggest that organisations should focus HRM policies and practices on family-friendly initiatives to further enhance family support resources to benefit individuals, families and organisations."",art";;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2023-0283;How and when does family incivility steer employees towards work delays: implications for HR. PurposeThe purpose of this study is to investigate the negative spillover effects of family incivility on employees' ability to meet their work-related deadlines. Furthermore, we examine emotional exhaustion as a mediator and emotional intelligence as a moderator in this process.Design/methodology/approachWe test our predictions through a multisource, time-separated data collection involving 161 employee-supervisor dyads working in various hospitality sector organizations in Pakistan - a relatively understudied context where the hospitality industry is struggling.FindingsThe findings of our study indicate that exposure to rude family behavior hinders employees' ability to complete work tasks on time, as mediated by their emotional exhaustion. However, this harmful process can be curtailed if employees can rely on their emotional intelligence to regulate their own emotions and those of their family members.Practical implicationsThe findings of this study provide pertinent insights for HR managers and organizations to help their employees deal with family issues. Moreover, organizations can benefit from introducing training programs that improve employees' emotional intelligence and increase the likelihood that they do not default on their work deadlines.Originality/valueThis study extends the limited existing family incivility research by investigating its spillover effects on employees' ability to meet work deadlines, a previously unexplored relationship. In addition, we highlight the roles of two pertinent aspects: emotional intelligence and emotional exhaustion.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2023-0841;Developing future competencies of people employed in non-standard forms of employment: employers' and employees' perspective. PurposeThe aim of this study is to analyze the differences between non-standard forms of employment (FoE) (i.e. dependent self-employment/business-to-business/B2B contract and contract of mandate) in terms of investing in the development of future competencies by employees and employers. This study also examined additional factors which influence these investments.Design/methodology/approachTo collect data, the computer-assisted telephone interview technique was used. 200 employees from different companies located in Poland participated in this study, wherein each of the above-mentioned FoEs (i.e. dependent self-employment and contract of mandate) was represented by 100 people. The Chi-Square test and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used in the statistical analyses.FindingsIn the case of only 2 out of 14 competencies, there were statistically significant differences between the two groups of respondents: the employers financed training courses for B2B employees more frequently than for mandate contract workers. Moreover, in only one case there was a statistically significant difference: the self-employed financed training courses themselves more often than mandate contract workers. This study revealed an important impact of other variables such as respondents' age, education level, parental status and industry on the training activities undertaken by employers and employees.Originality/valueAlthough the issue of developing future competencies is important, there is little research examining this problem in the context of people who work in non-standard FoE. Moreover, previous research primarily focused on identifying differences between people working under employment contracts and the self-employed. This article fills these research gaps as well as shows that more factors should be considered in the research models to get a deeper insight into the problem of non-standard FoEs.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2023-0035;Employee and customer loyalty: two targets, one endeavor?. PurposeRecently, leading scholars suggested that firms should align strategic and tactical human resource management efforts to cope with growing turnover rates, and that the human resource management field should broaden its scope by embracing the views of all stakeholders. In this research paper, the authors aim to present a study inquiring about the influence of the implementation of an employee experience strategy on employee loyalty and the effect of employee loyalty on customer loyalty in a firm operating in the service sector.Design/methodology/approachThe authors used longitudinal data collected yearly from 2020 to 2022. Overall, 766 employees participated in the longitudinal study. The authors also analyzed cross-sectional data from 166 employees and their customers.FindingsThe study's results suggest that implementing an employee experience strategy increases employee loyalty. The study's findings also indicate that organizations implementing such a human resource management strategy reach employee and customer loyalty.Originality/valueThere is a lack of evidence about the positive effect of the alignment of an employee experience strategy and tactics on different organizational stakeholders. This study provides insights for scholars and practitioners willing to use the employee and customer experience framework to positively impact organizations.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-03-2022-0211;Linking leader-member exchange and work-nonwork balance: the mediating role of thriving at work and the moderating role of gender. Purpose The authors tested (1) the mediating role of thriving in the association between leader-member exchange (LMX) and work-nonwork balance (WNWB) and (2) the moderating effect of gender in the relationship between LMX and thriving. Design/methodology/approach Cross-sectional data were collected from six separate participant groups across an eight-month period (n = 522). Data analysis included confirmatory factor analysis to assess the construct validity of the proposed three-factor model. Hierarchical regression and the PROCESS macro were used to test three hypotheses. Findings The authors found thriving mediated an indirect effect of LMX on WNWB. In addition, we found that the relationship between LMX and thriving was moderated by gender, such that the relationship was found for females. Overall, the authors identified a moderated-mediation effect indicating an indirect effect of LMX on WNWB via thriving for females. Research limitations/implications Cross-sectional design suggests their results are theory driven. The authors suggest future studies replicate the study employing experimental designs. Practical implications The authors suggest organisations develop programs to enhance leadership and thriving capabilities as tools to manage WNWB. Originality/value The authors add to the thriving literature by revealing gender differences in the effectiveness of relational resources (i.e. LMX) in fostering employee thriving. Furthermore, the authors extend the efficacy of thriving beyond the workplace to include WNWB. The authors demonstrate the skills and knowledge acquired at work can be used to lessen the impact of WNWB.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-11-2021-0782;Pay-for-performance, procedural justice, OCB and job performance: a sequential mediation model. Purpose Building on the arguments of expectancy theory and social exchange theory, the present study provides insights into the process by which pay-for-performance (PFP) impacts employee job performance. Design/methodology/approach Based on a sample size of 226 employees working in a technology company in India, the study examines the relationships between PFP, procedural justice, organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) and employee job performance. Data on perceptions of PFP and procedural justice were collected from the employees, data on OCB were collected from the supervisors and the data on employee job performance were collected from organizational appraisal records. Findings The study found support for the positive relationship between PFP and job performance and for the sequential mediation of the relationship between PFP and job performance via procedural justice and OCB. Further, procedural justice was found to mediate the relationship between PFP and OCB. Research limitations/implications The study was cross-sectional, so inferences about causality are limited. Practical implications The study tests the relationship between PFP and employee job performance in the Indian work context. The study shows that the existence of PFP is positively related to procedural justice which, in turn, is positively related to OCB. The study found support for the sequential mediation of PFP-job performance relationship via procedural justice and OCB. Originality/value The study provides an insight into the underlying process through which PFP is related to employee job performance. To the best of our knowledge, such a study is the first of its kind undertaken in an organizational context.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-11-2020-0836;Public service motivation and public employees' turnover intention: the role of job satisfaction and career growth opportunity. Purpose This study investigated the mediating role of job satisfaction and the moderating role of career growth opportunity in the relationship between public service motivation (PSM) and public employees' turnover intention. Design/methodology/approach The authors recruited 587 public employees from Yunnan Province, China to test moderation and mediation hypotheses. The authors conducted confirmatory factor analysis to determine the discriminant and convergent validity of the measures of PSM, turnover intention, job satisfaction and career growth opportunity. Finally, the authors carried out bootstrapping to ascertain direct, indirect and conditional indirect effects. Findings PSM had a negative effect on public employees' turnover intention, but this relationship was partially mediated by job satisfaction. Career growth opportunity moderated the association between job satisfaction and turnover intention. In particular, the indirect effect of PSM on turnover intention through job satisfaction weakened under high career growth opportunities. Practical implications The results highlighted the significance of PSM and career growth opportunity in shaping public employees' work-related attitudes and behaviors. Public organizations should consider PSM a key criterion in recruitment and selection and pay more attention to the significance of intervening in career growth to satisfy public employees' psychological needs related to individual career development. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature on the disputed link between PSM and turnover intention and uncovered the underlying mechanism through which PSM affects public employees' turnover intention by proposing job satisfaction and career growth opportunity as a mediator and moderator, respectively.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2021-0727;Free agents seeking for career support: exploring the expectations of skilled contingent workers vis-a-vis labour market intermediaries. Purpose Recent studies on contingent workers highlight their boundaryless and protean nature, and depict them as free agents who reject organisational forms of career support. Going beyond such current view, this paper aims to shed light on the career support provided by labour market intermediaries (LMIs) to skilled contingent workers (SCWs), the latter known as freelancers and consulting firms' employees. Design/methodology/approach Using a qualitative stance and an inductive approach, the authors draw on 33 interviews to grasp SCWs' discourses on the career support offered by LMIs, and their account managers. The thematic analysis reveals two main themes: the career support delivered by LMIs to SCWs, and the expectations of SCWs regarding potential additional forms of career support from LMIs. Findings The authors show that SCWs are supported by LMIs in their career via a number of career management practices and operational support, and account managers a likely to play a key role in the careers of SCWs by providing transactional and relational career support. Moreover, the authors stress that SCWs are free agents, yet seeking for forms of support from LMIs. Originality/value The present paper addresses the roles of LMIs regarding non-standard population of workers through the lens of SCWs, what has barely been undertaken in recent research. This paper also enriches current debates on the organisational support SCWs are willing to accept and benefit from, despite the idiosyncratic nature of their careers.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2020-0793;Growth mindsets increase flexible work arrangement attractiveness: a policy-capturing study. Purpose Although flexible work arrangements (FWAs) are widely regarded as a desirable employee benefit, questions remain about which factors drive (or attenuate) applicant attraction to them. The authors offer a novel theoretical account by advancing the concept of lay theories (i.e. mindsets) around an individual's ability to juggle work and life responsibilities, defined as beliefs that the ability to juggle is either malleable (i.e. growth) or cannot be changed (i.e. fixed), which suggests greater efficacy increases attraction. Design/methodology/approach Utilizing an experimental policy-capturing design, 86 participants each rated a series of 64 job offers (N = 5,376) with several manipulated job attributes. Participants were randomly assigned into a growth or fixed mindset condition. Findings Multilevel regressions revealed that a growth (vs fixed) mindset caused participants to place greater weight on flexible work scheduling policies by reporting greater attraction to jobs with flexible arrangements. Practical implications Organizations may increase applicant attraction by taking steps to ensure that the value of work-life benefits is salient, such as offering concrete examples of how policies have been used. Originality/value This study questions the assumption that those who need flexibility are more attracted to FWAs and demonstrates that beliefs around one's ability to juggle work-life demands are a unique mechanism shaping applicant attraction.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-12-2020-0860;Fear after being fired: the moderating role of resilience in lessening the time between employment. Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study how the interplay of the emotion of fear and the personality trait of resilience affect time to reemployment after job termination. The authors carried out the research by extending affective events theory (AET) beyond the workplace. Design/methodology/approach This paper is a conceptual paper intended to lay the groundwork for future analysis in the areas of fear and resilience, specifically in the time after job termination. Findings The paper suggests that fear is a natural response to job termination, and there are two responses to fear: one of action to rid oneself of fear (fight or flight) and one of paralysis, in which an individual remains in a fear state. The authors put forth that one's level of resilience is a factor in determining time to reemployment. Originality/value While there are numerous studies on the role emotions play in the workplace and in particular, the role of fear about potentially getting fired, there are few, if any, studies on the role of fear after losing a job. The authors feel this is a warranted area of study as fear can have both positive and negative responses. The authors also contend that a major diver of these fear responses is an individual's level of resilience, and this can be a significant predictor of the individual's time to reemployment.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2019-0211;Change ubiquity: employee perceptions of change prevalence from three countries. Purpose The purpose of this paper is to address assumptions about the prevalence of change in human resource management (HRM) and organizational change literature, providing evidence from employee perceptions across three countries. The results indicate change was commonplace even before the pandemic disruptions of 2020. Design/methodology/approach Given this study's exploratory, employee perspective, a cross-sectional self-report survey was used. Three survey panel samples were collected in 2017: US (n = 718), Australia (n = 501) and New Zealand (n = 516). Analysis of variance was used to test whether the prevalence of change differed significantly between countries or specific groups of employees. An analysis of comments on change types and emotional response provides further insights. Findings The paper provides evidence of the ubiquity of change: 73% of employees are experiencing change at work and 42% perceived it as moderate to massive, with little variation between countries. Employees commonly experience more than one change, with those experiencing large amounts of change reporting predominantly negative emotional impacts. Research limitations/implications The research provides a snapshot across three countries during a prosperous and relatively stable period, providing a point of comparison for the turbulent times we have faced in 2020 as the publication date will be 2021 the current text may not work as well. Since change can be arduous, the authors recommend that HRM researchers consider change prevalence as a contextual factor, and practitioners heed employee reactions to change, particularly during periods of significant change. Originality/value In providing foundational evidence of change ubiquity in contemporary workplaces, this paper enables more accurate discussions regarding change.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2020-0026;Cyberloafing in public sector of developing countries: job embeddedness as a context. Purpose This study aims to investigate the possible negativity of job embeddedness in developing countries. Operationally, the study aimed to configure the relationship between job embeddedness and cyberloafing with respect to both contextual (job satisfaction) and individual (internet addiction) factors. Design/methodology/approach Incorporating the conservation of resources theory and reactance theory into the theory of job embeddedness, the present study adopted a resource-based approach to job embeddedness to examine its main and moderated effects on cyberloafing in a three-way interaction model. With the focus on public organizations, 500 administrative employees from an Iranian university were surveyed using self-reporting measures, and the collected data were analyzed using partial least squares-structural equation modeling and hierarchical moderated multiple regression. Findings As predicted, job embeddedness was positively associated with cyberloafing;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-11-2023-0941;When customers become scapegoats: how negative gossip about organizational change can cause negative emotions and displaced aggression. Purpose - Based on affective events theory, this research attempted to investigate how negative gossip about organizational change drives employees to experience negative emotions and direct their aggression toward customers. Design/methodology/approach - We conducted a scenario-based experiment (Study 1) and a multiwave field survey (Study 2) to test our hypotheses. Findings - The results show that (1) negative emotions mediate the relationship between change-related negative gossip and displaced aggression toward customers;art;" and (4) change-related negative gossip has a strengthened (weakened) indirect effect on displaced aggression via negative emotions when employees have high perceived organizational constraints (future work self-salience). Originality/value - The study expands research on organizational change and displaced aggression and provides practical implications for managing organizational change."",art";;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2023-0071;The impact of organizational dehumanization on creative performance through self-esteem threat: the moderating role of work locus of control. Purpose - This paper aims to enhance our understanding of how organizational dehumanization affects employees' creative performance. We propose the self-esteem threat as a mediator in the relationship between organizational dehumanization and employees' creative performance. We also examine how work locus of control moderates the relationship between organizational dehumanization and creative performance. Design/methodology/approach - Through convenience sampling, online and face-to-face surveys, multisource time-lagged data (N = 257) were collected from full-time employees and their supervisors in Pakistani organizations in the information technology, media industry and oil and gas sectors. Findings - Organizational dehumanization negatively affects employees' creative performance, and threats to self-esteem mediate this relationship. Work locus of control moderates the effect of organizational dehumanization on creative performance, and this negative relationship is attenuated when individuals have an external work locus of control. Originality/value - This study provides novel insights into the process underlying the relationship between organizational dehumanization and creative performance by revealing the mediating role of threat to self-esteem and the buffering role of work locus of control.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2023-0854;A comprehensive meta-analysis of the impact of intervention programmes on psychological capital development: post-intervention and longer-term effects. Purpose - This paper presents the most up-to-date comprehensive meta-analysis of the effectiveness of interventions to enhance psychological capital (PsyCap). It also reports the first meta-analytic examination of longer-term effects (beyond the immediate post-intervention period). Design/methodology/approach - This meta-analysis followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines and utilised the methodologies of Hunter and Schmidt (2004) and Borenstein et al. (2009). The search period was from 2006 until February 2023. A total of 40 studies (N 5 4,207) were included in the meta-analyses. The analyses were performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) Version 4 software programme. Findings - The results indicate that the impacts of interventions on PsyCap and each of its component resources are greater than those reported in a previous meta-analysis (Lupsa et al., 2020), with the strongest impacts on hope and optimism. Interventions had sustained positive effects on PsyCap, hope, resilience and optimism, but not efficacy, and the frequency of intervention sessions influenced the effectiveness of interventions on hope, efficacy and optimism. Interestingly, specific PsyCap-focussed interventions did not have the greatest impact on PsyCap or its component resources. Originality/value - This study contributes to emerging research on wellbeing-oriented HRM and provides valuable insights into more effective design and implementation of interventions to enhance PsyCap and its component resources. These interventions are a promising form of investment in employees which may bring mutual gains for individuals and organisations. The present findings extend those of previous studies and specifically respond to the call for further research on the persistence of PsyCap intervention effects.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-07-2023-0555;Bouncing back: HR professionals' experiences during times of disruption. PurposeThis study investigates human resource (HR) professionals' experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic.Design/methodology/approachThe study involves in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 37 HR professionals purposefully selected based on their prior involvement in managing pandemic-related challenges.FindingsThe findings reveal that HR professionals faced intensified organizational demands, leading to expanded job roles, increased workload, a change in pace and emotional pressures. However, participants exhibited resilience by drawing from and creating various job resources to cope with these demands. Our findings also show that despite HR professionals being central to creating workplace support and wellness initiatives, their well-being needs were often overlooked as they prioritized supporting others.Research limitations/implicationsThe study contributes to research on the experiences of HR professionals during the pandemic and to job-demands resources (JD-R) theory by incorporating context-specific demands, resources and coping strategies specific to HR professionals.Practical implicationsLessons learned for organizations and HR professionals are discussed in relation to creating conditions of organizational support and resource availability for HR professionals.Originality/valueThis study extends research on the mental health and well-being of HR professionals during the pandemic by providing a novel lens on linkages between job demands, job resources and self-regulation strategies.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-08-2020-0641;Internal and external networking behaviors and employee outcomes: a test of gender moderating effect. PurposeResearch suggests that engaging in networking behaviors can affect individual work outcomes. However, relatively less is known about how internal versus external networking behaviors influence work outcomes, and whether gender moderates these relationships. Drawing on social capital theory and social role theory, the authors propose a positive relationship between employees' internal and external networking behaviors and their work outcomes (job commitment and career success), and the moderating effect of gender. The authors also explore employee preference in networking.Design/methodology/approachBased on a sequential mixed-method research design with a four-month time lag, Study 1 data on networking behaviors and employee outcomes were collected via a survey of middle managers and their supervisors from 10 private sector organizations in Sri Lanka. Study 2 data were collected via interviews from a sample of those middle managers and their supervisors.FindingsStudy 1 findings indicate a positive relationship between internal networking behaviors and job commitment, and external networking behaviors and career success. The authors also found that internal networking behaviors enhance job commitment. Study 2 findings indicate men and women network differently and benefit differently from that networking but achieve equitable workplace benefits.Originality/valueThis study provides pioneering evidence that internal networking behaviors enhance job commitment among women. It appears that past research did not test the moderating effect of gender for internal versus external networking behaviors separately. Moreover, this study refines the evidence that internal and external networking behaviors differentially impact employee outcomes and explains the processes through a qualitative inquiry.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-07-2022-0470;Transformational leadership, idiosyncratic deals and employee outcomes. PurposeTransformational leadership (TFL) has been suggested to create positive changes in employees with the goal of developing them into leaders. The authors integrate this well-established leadership style with recent research on idiosyncratic deals (i-deals). The authors suggest TFL as a predictor of task and development-based i-deals, and propose i-deals as a mediating mechanism linking TFL to employee outcomes (job satisfaction, job stress and manager-rated performance).Design/methodology/approachThe authors used a time-lagged research design, and collected four waves of data from 140 employees and 78 leaders.FindingsTFL was found to be an important predictor of i-deals. I-deals predicted job satisfaction and job stress;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-03-2022-0201;On whose side are you: perspective-taking and attribution of blame in handling sexual harassment complaints. PurposeThe authors aim to explore how perspective-taking and attribution of blame lead to side-taking by human resource professionals (HRPs) when making judgements and handling complaints of sexual harassment.Design/methodology/approachEmploying qualitative methodology, the authors used semi-structured in-depth interviews with 35 HRPs from 30 companies in Sri Lanka. Attribution theory and perspective-taking were used as theoretical lenses.FindingsIn handling complaints of sexual harassment incidents, HRPs take the perspectives of the alleged perpetrator, complainant, or the company and attribute the blame to the alleged perpetrator or the complainant. Irrespective of the gender of the HRPs and the perspective they take, they would most often blame the female complainants due to sexual harassment myths and misperceptions and traditional sex-role beliefs. Thus, they either take the side of the alleged perpetrator or the company, explicitly/implicitly or intentionally/unintentionally.Originality/valueThe central originality of this research is the finding that HRPs take sides in resolving complaints of sexual harassment and perspective-taking and attribution of blame by HRPs lead to this side-taking in organisational settings.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2021-0420;Being authentic by sharing team vision: mediating role of strengths use within a team. Purpose Authenticity, or the extent to which individuals act in accordance with their values, beliefs and characteristics, is recognized as a key component of a fulfilled life. However, little is known about its antecedents in an organizational context. Drawing on goal-setting theory and the broaden-and-build theory, the current study examined the role of team leaders' perceived shared vision in promoting their work authenticity, mediated through strengths use support (SUS) for members as well as leaders' strengths use. Design/methodology/approach A two-wave questionnaire survey was conducted to test the hypotheses using a sample of 325 middle managers of a manufacturing firm. Findings The results of structural equation modeling show that perceived shared vision promoted work authenticity, mediated through SUS and strengths use. Originality/value This study is the first to identify that shared goals can trigger authenticity at work by directing the leader to use their strengths, alongside their team members.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2022-0176;An empirical analysis of facilitators and barriers to the hybrid work model: a cross-cultural and multi-theoretical approach. Purpose This paper examines the influence of facilitators and barriers on employees' preference to work in a hybrid model. The study uses the theoretical lens of stimulus-organism-response (SOR) and dual factor theory (DFT). It examines the influence of health consciousness (stimulus), facilitators (e.g. work flexibility, work-life balance and team building) (organism) and barriers (e.g. pandemic and travel stressor and role overload [organism] on employees' preference to work in a hybrid model) (response). Further, it tests the moderating influence of organizational culture. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey was conducted among employees in India, Sri Lanka and Germany, obtaining 281 usable questionnaires. Structural equation modeling (SEM) using Warp PLS 7.0 was used as the analytical technique to examine the model fit and test hypotheses. Findings The findings reveal that health consciousness is essential in enhancing facilitators and motivating employees to prefer a hybrid working model. The study's findings also prove the positive influence of work flexibility, work-life balance and team building as facilitators. The results suggest that pandemic and travel stressors inhibit employees' preference for working in a hybrid model. Research limitations/implications The study is based on a cross-sectional research design to generalise the findings. Future researchers can utilize longitudinal design to decipher the variation in response over time. The study has developed a model combining SOR with DFT;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2021-0114;CEO environmentally specific transformational leadership and firm proactive environmental strategy: roles of TMT green commitment and regulative pressure. Purpose This research aims to focus on the environmentally specific transformational leadership (ETFL) of a chief executive officer (CEO) and aims to examine the effect of CEOs' ETFL on firm's proactive environmental strategies (PESs), by indicating the top management team's (TMT) green commitment as a mediator and regulative pressure as a moderator to understand the relation. Design/methodology/approach This study used multisource data from 170 small-to medium-sized manufacturing firms in China. Findings The results indicated that CEOs' ETFL was positively related to the TMT's green commitment, which, in turn, enhanced the firm's PESs. Moreover, regulative pressure strengthened the direct effect of CEOs' ETFL on their TMTs' green commitment and the indirect effect of CEOs' ETFL on the firm's PESs via TMTs' green commitment. Originality/value The tested importance of regulative pressure as an external condition that strengthens the effectiveness of CEOs' ETFL offers new theoretical insights to advance the literature on PESs.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-08-2021-0602;Serving for thriving: a moderated mediation analysis of the relationship between servant leadership and thriving at work. Purpose Drawing on the socially embedded model of thriving at work, this study aims to test a moderated mediation model to elucidate the mediating effect of work meaningfulness and the moderating role of perceived interpersonal justice on the relationship between servant leadership and thriving at work. Design/methodology/approach Based on a sample of 221 employees from the manufacturing industry in South Korea, a series of hierarchical regression analyses were conducted by using statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) software. For conducting moderated mediation analysis, the PROCESS macro for SPSS was utilized. Findings The findings show that servant leadership significantly relates to thriving at work, and work meaningfulness and perceived interpersonal justice act as a mediating mechanism and a boundary condition, respectively. Based on moderated mediation analysis, the collective effect of servant leadership, work meaningfulness and perceived interpersonal justice on thriving at work were also confirmed. Practical implications The findings suggest that organizations should adopt servant leadership to promote employee thriving at work. In doing so, it is important to ensure that employees experience work meaningfulness, and are treated with respect and dignity. Originality/value This study extends research on servant leadership, and sheds light on important mechanisms and boundary conditions under which servant leadership promotes thriving at work.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04C321-0234;Benevolent leadership and organizational citizenship behaviors in a higher education context: a moderated mediation model. Purpose - Drawing upon the conservation of resources (COR) theory, this paper investigates the moderated mediation model linking benevolent leadership to organizational citizenship behaviors towards the organization (OCBO) and towards individuals (OCBI) in the context of higher education. The mediating roles of leader-member exchange and affective commitment as well as the moderating roles of the two attachment styles-attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance-are also examined.Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from a sample of 333 university lecturers and analyzed using partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM).Findings - The results demonstrate that leader-member exchange and affective commitment are mediating resources that help benevolent leaders motivate university lecturers to engage in two types of OCBs. Moreover, attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance act as the respective enhancer and inhibitor for the indirect effects of benevolent leadership on both OCBs through leader-member exchange. In contrast, the relationships between benevolent leadership and two types of OCBs through the mediating role of affective commitment are not contingent on the attachment styles of lecturers.Practical implications - The findings suggest that university leaders who aim at promoting OCBs among lecturers should deploy benevolent leadership style to facilitate a positive social exchange relationship as well as foster their affective commitment. Such leadership style is especially effective in influencing lecturers who possess attachment anxiety personality traits.Originality/value - This pioneer research develops and empirically tests a COR theory-grounded moderated mediation model pertaining to benevolent leadership and lecturers' OCBs. The findings contribute to the educational management literature by demonstrating that benevolent leadership, a crucial organizational resource, significantly motivates lecturers' voluntary and extra-role behaviors in a dynamic and contingent manner. Leader-member exchange and affective commitment are important mediating resources in the process of transforming benevolent leadership into beneficial behaviors. Further, the effectiveness of benevolent leadership largely depends on lecturers' personality traits of attachment anxiety and avoidance. These novel mediating and moderating findings demonstrate the sequential and interaction effects of various organizational and individual resources on lecturers' OCBs;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2019-0003;Female workers' career success in the handicraft industry: a study of Uttarakhand, India. Purpose This work is an extension of research on worker participation in achieving career success by including a prominent contextual construct, that is social capital. The present research aims to study how competency development influences the intrinsic career success of females in the handicraft industry, by considering the role of perceived employability as a mediator and social capital as a moderator. By doing so, this paper aims to fill the vacuum in the career literature that suggests that career success is not gender neutral. Design/methodology/approach Data was collected from handicraft workers by adopting the survey method. CFA and SPSS macro named PROCESS were used to analyse data. Findings Competency development influences the subjective career success of female workers, and perceived employability mediated the relationship between them. Moreover, social capital independently moderates the relationship between the participation of workers in competency development and perceived employability. Research limitations/implications The study is conducted in the Indian context alone, and therefore future studies must be conducted globally to deepen the scholarly dialogue on female workers' career success. Also, the current study measures career success, from a subjective perspective, thus future studies can measure female workers' objective career success. Practical implications The current paper identifies the need to study the factors contributing to female workers' career success in small industries. Social implications Conventional industries and their workers' career success must be given equal importance by researchers, practitioners and policymakers. Originality/value The paper fills the gap in career research by exploring female workers' career success through empirical evidence.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2021-0294;Does intraorganizational competition prompt or hinder performance? The risks for proactive employees who hide knowledge. Purpose This study examines whether employees' perceptions of intraorganizational competition, defined as beliefs that the organization evaluates their performance in comparison with others, result in lower supervisor ratings of their conscientiousness if the employees, particularly those with proactive personalities, respond to the resource-draining, competitive work situation with knowledge hiding behavior. Design/methodology/approach Multisource data were collected from employees and supervisors in different industries at three points in time. The research hypotheses were tested with hierarchical multiple regression analysis, in combination with PROCESS macro-based bootstrapping, to assess mediation and moderated mediation. Findings Beliefs about highly competitive organizational climates are counterproductive, in that they lead employees to conceal knowledge intentionally from other organizational members. This mediating role of knowledge concealment is particularly prominent among employees with a strong desire to take the initiative to protect themselves against the hardships created by a climate of internal competition. Research limitations/implications The research design does not allow for formal tests of causality. Practical implications For human resource managers, this research pinpoints self-protective knowledge hiding as a key, detrimental mechanism. It imposes dual harms: employees feel threatened by the strict performance-oriented climate, and their defensive reactions make them appear less conscientious to supervisors. This downward spiral is particularly likely to initiate among employees who exhibit a disposition toward action. Originality/value This research investigates novel connections between specific organizational elements and outcomes, by specifying why and when employees' beliefs about performance-oriented organizational climates might backfire, due to their negative behavioral responses, such as purposeful knowledge hiding.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-08-2020-0607;Perception of organizational politics, knowledge hiding and organizational citizenship behavior: the moderating effect of political skill. Purpose Based on the conservation of resource (COR) theory, this study investigates the association between the perception of organizational politics and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) while considering the mediating role of knowledge hiding and moderating role of political skill in this process. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected in a time-lagged survey in two waves with a three-week interval from frontline employees and their peers working in private sector banks in India. The hypothesized relationships were ascertained using the PROCESS macro for SPSS. Findings The results revealed a negative association between the perception of organizational politics and OCBs targeted at co-workers (OCBI), organization (OCBO) and customers (OCBC), both directly and indirectly, via knowledge hiding. Additionally, the negative indirect effect of the perception of organizational politics on OCB facets, via knowledge hiding, is buffered for individuals with high levels of political skill. Originality/value The current study portrays a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics between the perception of organizational politics and OCB, with a particular emphasis on identifying the unidentified factors that may impact this liaison.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-03-2021-0223;Formalization and employee thriving at work: a moderated mediation model including work engagement and centralization. Purpose Until recently, scholars have begun to examine the contextual antecedents of employees thriving at work. A recent study has shown that one aspect of organizational structure/context (i.e. formalization) can be an important antecedent of employee thriving at work. However, scholars have urged doing research examining how different aspects of organizational structure can combinedly influence employee work outcomes such as thriving at work. Given that, the present paper proposes a theoretical model to unravel the mechanisms of how two aspects of organizational structure (i.e. formalization and centralization) may operate as the antecedents of employees thriving at work. In particular, the author draws on the Conservation of Resources Theory (COR) to hypothesize that employees' work engagement mediates the relationship between their perception of formalization and thriving at work. The author further hypothesizes that the indirect relationship between formalization and employee thriving at work is moderated by employees' perception of centralization, such that the relationship is stronger in the presence of a lower level of centralization than higher. Design/methodology/approach The author gathered data by employing a time-lagged survey design involving 136 full-time employees from different organizations. Findings Results show that employee work engagement mediates the relationship between formalization and employee thriving at work. Further, the indirect relationship between formalization and employee thriving at work is stronger when the level of centralization is relatively low. Research limitations/implications Formalization is able to enact employees' thriving at work, particularly when organization implements relatively less centralized structure. Originality/value This study first introduces work engagement as a mediator in the formalization-employee thriving at work relationship and centralization as a moderator along this mediating process.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2020-0072;Expatriates' dual commitment: a serial multiple mediation model of workplace friendships and adjustment. Purpose The purpose of this article is to advance the understanding of expatriates' psychological attachment toward both their parent company and its foreign subsidiary by highlighting how workplace friendships enhance the process of adjustment for expatriates and how these effects on adjustment subsequently translate into expatriates' dual commitment. Design/methodology/approach Hypotheses were tested using a sample of 187 expatriates, working in managerial positions, in subsidiaries of multinational corporations, all of whom were assigned expatriates. Serial multiple indirect effects were tested. Findings The results indicated that the relationship between workplace friendships and interaction adjustment was supported, but the relationship between workplace friendships and work adjustment was not supported. The serial indirect effects of international adjustment and work adjustment on the relationship between interaction adjustment and expatriates' dual commitment were supported. Originality/value This study seeks to fill a gap in the research literature on expatriates by focusing on the issue of workplace friendships and expatriates' dual commitment. The findings help bolster the literature on relational schemas in that expatriates' workplace friendships establish scripts for expatriates' expected outlines of adjustment in work domains. This study also provides insights relevant to the literature on social interaction and adjustment, as the findings support our theory that expatriate commitment is not directly contingent on workplace friendships but rather on the mediating roles of both interaction adjustment and work adjustment.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2020-0257;Trickle-down effect of moral leadership on unethical employee behavior: a cross-level moderated mediation model. Purpose Moral leadership is a common leadership style in Chinese society and is of great significance to Chinese organizations. Unethical employee behavior also widely exists in all kinds of social organizations and brings great harm. The research on the relationship between moral leadership and unethical employee behavior has not been involved yet, but it is important. This paper studies how moral manager (senior leader) leadership trickles down to unethical employee behavior through moral supervisor (employee direct supervisor) leadership, and discusses the moderating effect of LMX and ethical climate. Design/methodology/approach Through the questionnaire survey of 406 pairs of leaders and employees, and use multilevel path analysis, we test the hypothesis in this paper. Findings The research results show that (1) Moral manager leadership is negatively related to unethical employee behavior. (2) Moral supervisor leadership mediates the relationship between moral manager leadership and unethical employee behavior. (3) LMX positively moderates the relationship between moral manager leadership and moral supervisor leadership, and moderates the mediating effect of moral supervisor leadership. (4) Ethical climate positively moderates the relationship between moral supervisor leadership and unethical employee behavior, and moderates the mediating effect of moral supervisor leadership. Originality/value First, this study further proves that moral leadership is a popular positive leadership among the three dimensions of paternalistic leadership that extends its influence to unethical employee behavior. Second, this study traces the source of the moral leadership of employees' supervisors and reveals the action mechanism of how moral manager leadership affects unethical employee behavior. Finally, LMX provides the organizational context of the trickle-down effect and the occurrence of unethical employee behavior.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-07-2020-0547;Exploring the linkages between job demands and recovery self-efficacy: a resource perspective of the school-work interface. Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the indirect impact of job demands on recovery self-efficacy via the mediation of job burnout. The study also investigates the moderating effects of school-to-work facilitation and psychological detachment in the indirect relationship between job demands and recovery self-efficacy. Design/methodology/approach The study recruited and surveyed 263 employed graduate students in the executive master of business administration program in Taiwan. Regression analysis was used to examine the proposed relationships. Findings The results showed that job burnout mediated the relationship between job demands and recovery self-efficacy. The relationship was weaker when school-to-work facilitation and psychological detachment were high. Originality/value This study confirms the indirect effects of job demands on recover self-efficacy through job burnout and provides new insights into the role of school-to-work facilitation and psychological detachment to enhance the recovery in the JD-R model.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-07-2020-0566;How perception of training impacts organizational citizenship behavior: power distance as moderator. Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between perception of training, organizational commitment and organizational citizenship behavior. Moreover, the study examines the moderating role of power distance on the relationship between perception of training and organizational commitment. Design/methodology/approach Using stratified sampling technique, the data were obtained from 379 employees working at branches of public and private banks located in five metropolitan cities in Pakistan. To test the established hypotheses, structural equation modeling technique was adopted using Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) 21.0. Findings The findings stated a significant relationship between perception of training and organizational citizenship behavior, but there was no relationship found between perception of training and organizational commitment. Moreover, organizational commitment partly mediated the relationship between perception of training and organizational citizenship behavior. The results also described that power distance moderates the relationship between perception of training and organizational commitment. Practical implications The results of the study can be beneficial for banking sector and strategy makers who have extended vision and anticipate organizational citizenship behavior from their employees. The study also offers the scope and space for the prospective researchers and scholars to carry out further research. Originality/value There is extensive literature available on the relationship between perception of training, organizational commitment and organizational citizenship behavior. However, it is observed that very few studies took the opportunity to examine the moderating role of power distance on the relationship between perception of training and organizational commitment, particularly in the context of Pakistan. Therefore, this study can be considered as original and have a great value in understanding the developed relationships in the scenario of Pakistan.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-09-2019-0472;Leaders' trait signaling effect on followers' psychological contract dynamics. Purpose Using signaling theory and the literature on psychological contracts, the authors investigate how leaders' personalities shape their followers' perceptions of the type of psychological contract formed. They also suggest that leaders' personalities impact their followers' perceived contract breach. Furthermore, the authors propose that power distance orientation in organizations acts as an important boundary condition that enhances or exacerbates the relationships between personality and contract type and personality and perceived breach. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected through multiple sources in Pakistan from 456 employees employed in 102 bank branches. Multilevel moderated path analyses provided reasonably good support for our hypotheses. Findings The leaders' personalities impacted the relational contracts of their followers in the cases of extraversion and agreeableness, whereas neuroticism had a significant relationship with the followers' formation of transactional contracts. Similarly, agreeableness, neuroticism and conscientiousness had significant relationships with perceived breach. Finally, the power distance of the followers aggregated at a group level moderated the personality-contract type and personality-perceived breach relationships. Research limitations/implications This research advances understanding of psychological contracts in organizations. More specifically, it shows that the personality of leader would have profound impact on the type of contract their employees form and the likelihood that would perceive the breach of contract. Originality/value This research extends existing personality-psychological contract literature by examining the role of leaders' personalities in signaling to employees the type of contract that is formed and the perception of its breach. The role of power distance organizational culture as a signaling environment is also considered.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-11-2018-0465;The influences of abusive supervision on job satisfaction and mental health: the path through emotional labor. Purpose The purpose of the study is to empirically test and explore the influences of abusive supervision on subordinates' job satisfaction and mental health. Specifically, the authors focus on the mediation effects of emotional labor and compare the discrepancies between surface acting and deep acting. Design/methodology/approach Time-lagged data were obtained from 239 employees in the hospitality industry in Taiwan. The hypothesized model was tested using structural equation modeling with Mplus 7.4. Findings Results showed that abusive supervision is not only negatively related to employees' job satisfaction and mental health but also positively associated with employee surface acting and negatively associated with deep acting. For mediating effects, surface acting mediates the relationships between abusive supervision and employee job satisfaction, while deep acting mediates the relationship between abusive supervision and mental health. Practical implications Abusive supervision is detrimental;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2023-0849;Does job gamification perception promote the job involvement of gig workers? The role of cognitive assessment and overwork-evidence from Chinese delivery platforms. PurposeThis paper takes the gig workers in Chinese delivery platform as the research object and adopts a questionnaire survey to explore the complex influence of job gamification perception on the job involvement of gig workers, via the mediating role of cognitive assessment and moderating role of overwork, in order to provide research and data support for the development of platform gamification.Design/methodology/approachThe study conducted a three-wave online questionnaire survey to obtain 300 final samples from Chinese delivery platforms. Hypotheses were tested hierarchical regression and bootstrap methods.FindingsDrawing on cognitive appraisal theory, we observed an inverted U-shaped relationship of gig workers between job gamification perception and job involvement. The mediating role of cognitive assessment and moderating role of overwork were also considered. Both challenge and threat assessment mediate the relationship between job gamification perception and job involvement. Direct effect of job gamification perception on job involvement and indirect effect of job gamification perception on cognitive assessment are moderated by overwork.Originality/valueIn the past, the research on job gamification mostly focused on the traditional forms of employment, but this study focuses on the new forms of employment and from the perspective of individual self-perception, explores the influence of job gamification perception on the job involvement of gig workers in Chinese delivery platform and investigated the dialectical role of job gamification perception. The findings enrich the literature and theoretical research on job gamification perception and job involvement and provide new references and perspectives for management practice.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2022-0707;Effects of performance appraisal on employees' extra-role behaviors and turnover intentions - A parallel mediation model. Purpose Research on the underlying mechanisms that transfer the effects of performance appraisal (PA) on employees' behaviors and intentions remains scarce. The social exchange view of performance appraisal can be a source of deeper understanding about these underlying mechanisms. This study aims to investigate how psychological empowerment (PE) and organizational commitment (OC) explain the link between performance appraisal and three important distal outcomes: voice behavior (VB), organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), and turnover intentions (TOI). Design/methodology/approach The current study utilizes two wave - two source data from a sample of 250 employees and their supervisors from private organizations in Pakistan and tested the mediation model using SMART-PLS. Findings Results demonstrated that organizational commitment mediated the effects of performance appraisal on VB, OCB, and TOI, whereas psychological empowerment mediated the effects of performance appraisal on VB and OCB. These results have significant implications for theory and practice. Originality/value This study adopts the social exchange perspective to examine the mediation mechanisms linking PA with the three distal outcomes: VB, OCB and TOI. The paper identifies two novel mediators of PA - outcome relationship, i.e., psychological empowerment and organizational commitment.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2023-0512;Mindfulness and psychological capital: examining the role of intention from the person perspective in a multi-week mindfulness training program. PurposeWhen evaluating the efficacy of mindfulness interventions, most studies take a linear approach to explore how an intervention impacts different outcomes for individuals, and rarely is the role of intention examined. This research takes a configural approach to consider how various elements of a participant's training expectations and their experience in the training condition combine to predict increases in psychological capital.Design/methodology/approachEmployees from hospital settings were randomized into three conditions (mindfulness training, active control (Pilates), and wait-list control group) and completed surveys at three time points (baseline, post-training and three months post-training). A qualitative comparative analysis was applied to see what combinations of motivational elements were associated with increases in psychological capital.FindingsWe find that all three conditions can boost their psychological capital based on different configurations involving efficacy beliefs, baseline states of well-being (psychological capital and perceived stress) and changes in levels of mindfulness and perceived stress.Research limitations/implicationsIndividual characteristics, like motivation, expectancy and baseline needs, are an important consideration in addition to the training condition itself when determining whether a training is efficacious.Practical implicationsIt is of increasing importance that organizations find ways to support employee well-being. Offering a variety of psychological and physical interventions can improve psychological capital. Applying needs assessments that clarify the desires, needs and expectations employees hold may help with intervention efficacy.Originality/valueThe current study offers an innovative methodology through which realist evaluation approaches can consider multiple factors to predict outcomes.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-07-2022-0474;Perceived overqualification, work-related boredom, and intention to leave: examining the moderating role of high-performance work systems. PurposePrior studies have shown various mediating and moderating mechanisms regarding the effect of employees' perceived overqualification on intention to leave (ITL). Nonetheless, only a few empirical studies have shed light on the negative underlying processes that explain this relationship. Furthermore, less is known about the role of high-performance work systems (HPWSs) in the overqualification literature. Drawing upon relative deprivation theory (RDT), this research attempts to fill these gaps by examining the mediating role of work-related boredom and the moderating role of perceived HPWSs in the association between perceived overqualification and ITL.Design/methodology/approachData from a sample of 188 employees working in a Greek manufacturing company were analyzed using the PROCESS macros for SPSS.FindingsThe results indicated that work-related boredom mediates the association between perceived overqualification and ITL. Moreover, HPWSs attenuated the relationship of perceived overqualification with both work-related boredom and ITL, such that their association was positive only when employees' perceptions of HPWSs were low.Originality/valueThis study adds to the existing literature regarding why and how perceived overqualification affects ITL. Even more, this is one of the first studies that examine the role of HPWSs in the literature of overqualification. Theoretical and practical implications were also considered.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-09-2021-0632;Employees' HR attributions count: the effects of high-performance work systems on employees' thriving at work and emotional exhaustion. PurposeAlthough prior research has documented substantive knowledge of the benefits of high-performance work systems (HPWS), results regarding both sides of HPWS are inconsistent. To reconcile these inconsistencies, the authors identified two specific HR attributions-employee well-being HR attribution and performance HR attribution, and examined their roles in the relationship between team-level HPWS and employees' thriving at work and emotional exhaustion.Design/methodology/approachThe authors collected multi-source data from 36 team leaders and 181 individuals. Given the nested nature of the data, the authors used Mplus 7.4 to conduct multilevel structural equation modeling for hypothesis testing.FindingsThe results showed that team-level HPWS and employee well-being HR attribution interact to affect psychological availability, which subsequently promotes thriving at work. However, team-level HPWS and employee performance HR attribution do not interact to influence role overload/psychological availability;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1108/PR-07-2022-0468;Inside out and upside down? Perceptions of temporary employment histories in the time of COVID. PurposePerceptions of employment histories are important insofar as they influence future job prospects. Critically, in light of the current pandemic, wherein many individuals are likely to have unanticipated employment gaps and/or temporary work experiences, this exploratory study aims to seek a better understanding of the signal associated with temporary employment histories, which is particularly germane to individuals' employment trajectories and a successful labour market recovery.Design/methodology/approachDrawing primarily on signalling theory and using a simulated hiring decision experiment, the authors examined the perceptions of temporary employment histories, as well as the period effect of COVID-19, a major exogenous event, on the attitudes of fictitious jobseekers with standard, temporary and unemployment histories.FindingsThe authors find that prior to COVID-19 unemployed and temporary-work candidates were perceived less favourably as compared to applicants employed in a permanent job. During the COVID-19 pandemic, assessments of jobseekers with temporary employment histories were less critical and the previously negative signal associated with job-hopping reversed. This study's third wave of data, which were collected post-COVID, showed that such perceptions largely dissipated, with the exception for those with a history of temporary work with different employers.Practical implicationsThe paper serves as a reminder to check, insofar as possible, preconceived biases of temporary employment histories to avoid potential attribution errors and miss otherwise capable candidates.Originality/valueThis paper makes a unique and timely contribution by focussing and examining the differential effect of economic climate, pivoted by the COVID-19 pandemic, on perceptions of temporary employment histories.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2022-0111;Home-based telework and job stress: the mediation effect of work extension. Purpose This paper aims to investigate how home-based telework (HBT) affects job stress. The authors argue that an intrinsic effect of telework like work extension mediates this relationship. Work extension is reflected in two employee behaviours: working in free time and presentism.Design/methodology/approach The proposed model has been estimated using the Preacher and Hayes bootstrap method for multiple mediation analysis, with 1,000 repetitions. The data used come from the sixth European Working Conditions Survey.Findings The analysis indicates that HBT does not pose an inherent risk for job stress but causes a change in the employees' behaviour, increasing working in free time and presenteeism and thus job stress. The mediation model indicates that once these behaviours are controlled, the effect of HBT is to reduce stress.Research limitations/implicationsThe authors argue that companies should focus on human resource practices to control workers' behaviours that have a detrimental effect on job stress while institutions should regulate HBT.Originality/value The analysis deepens the unclear relationship between HBT and job stress by introducing employees' behaviours concerning work extension into the equation.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-08-2021-0582;Turnover intentions: the roles of job satisfaction and family support. Purpose This paper examines the factors that influence the work attitudes of employees and the conditional effects of family support on the job demand-turnover intention relationship. Design/methodology/approach The authors used a sample of 231 employees working in the manufacturing industry in Vietnam to test the conceptual model. Findings Drawing upon the job demands-resources (JD-R) model and job embeddedness theory, the authors found that employees' psychological capital and family support influenced turnover intentions through enhancing their job satisfaction. The authors also found that the influence of job demands on turnover intentions was altered when employees had higher levels of family support. Originality/value This study provides important insights for human resource managers regarding what may influence employees' job satisfaction and turnover intentions. The findings advance turnover literature by highlighting the important roles of both internal resources (psychological capital) and external resources (family support) in influencing employee turnover intentions in Vietnam.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2021-0285;Emotional culture of joy and happiness at work as a facet of wellbeing: a mediation of psychological safety and relational attachment. Purpose Drawing upon theories of conservation of resources (COR), broaden-and-build (BnB), self-determination, and the job demands- resources (JD-R) model, this study uniquely tries to understand the mechanisms that contribute to happiness at work by proposing a model of the effects of emotional culture of joy on happiness at work, where psychological safety and relational attachments serve as intervening mechanisms among the aforesaid relationship. Design/methodology/approach A three-wave time-lagged study with 340 employees from Pakistani organizations was conducted. Data were analyzed using covariance-based structural equation modelling. Findings The results indicate that emotional culture of joy significantly predicts happiness at work. Furthermore, emotional culture of joy significantly and positively influences both psychological safety and relational attachment. Finally, the relationship between emotional culture of joy and happiness at work is found to be mediated by both relational attachment and psychological safety. Practical implications The results are of utmost importance as they provide insights to policy makers and organizations administrators on the value of emotional culture of joy and its contribution to employees' wellbeing, and indeed its role in fostering important psychological and emotional resources such as psychological safety and relational attachment. Originality/value This study is unique for the following reasons. First, it addresses and bridges a gap pertaining to the drivers of happiness at work. Second, this is the first study that considers emotional culture of joy as an antecedent to happiness at work. Third, the employment of both psychological safety and relational attachment as intervening mechanisms in the relationship between emotional culture of joy and happiness at work has not been previously addressed in the management and wellbeing literature. Finally, the study shifts direction from studying organizational drivers (i.e. HR, organization support, etc.) of happiness at work to the examination of psychological and emotional resources that may influence happiness at work.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-03-2021-0179;The impact of role overload on job crafting from the perspective of construal level theory. Purpose Previous studies have vague views about whether employees who are required to complete large amounts of work (i.e. role overload) would proactively create a change in their job characteristics (i.e. job crafting), because the cognitive mechanism underlying the nexus between role overload and job crafting is unclear. The aim of this study is to identify why and when role overload has an impact on job crafting. Design/methodology/approach This study builds a second-stage moderated mediation model. Using a two-wave panel field study of 213 employee-supervisor matched data, this study examines the proposed hypotheses. Findings Results show that role overload decreases construal level, which can determine the tendency of employees to focus on the feasibility (low level of construal) or desirability (high level of construal) of behaviors. Goal self-concordance is the degree to which employees pursue their personal goals based on feelings of personal interests and values. The authors find that goal self-concordance guides employees who have higher levels of construal to exert more effort in job crafting. The authors further find that goal self-concordance moderates the mediating role of construal level. Specifically, for employees in pursuit of self-concordant goals, role overload reduces their construal level, resulting in less effort in job crafting. For employees who do not pursue self-concordant goals, role overload decreases their construal level, thereby improving job crafting. Originality/value The findings of this study enrich the literature on role overload and job crafting by revealing the mechanism and boundary conditions of the relationship between role overload and job crafting.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2021-0006;A qualitative investigation of the work-nonwork experiences of dual-career professional couples without children. Purpose This paper aims to investigate the idiosyncratic relationships between work and nonwork among dual-career professional couples (DCPCs) intentionally without children, considering individual members' role salience, nonwork responsibilities and care or career orientation. Design/methodology/approach Interview data from 21 Canadian and American couples (42 individuals) was used to explore the research question: How do DCPCs without children perceive their work-nonwork balance? Findings DCPCs without children are a heterogenous demographic. Some couples are career oriented, some care oriented, some exhibit both orientations, shaping their experience of work-nonwork balance. Unlike popular stereotypes, they do have nonwork responsibilities and interests outside of their thriving careers. Similar to their counterparts with children, they face conflicts managing work and nonwork domains. Originality/value Based on theories of role salience, work-nonwork conflict, enrichment and balance, the authors suggest that analyses of work-nonwork balance should include nonwork activities other than child caring. The authors further propose that the experience of the work-nonwork interface varies according to whether couples are careerist, conventional, non-conventional or egalitarian. The study also demonstrates that work-nonwork experiences are relational in nature and should be explored beyond a strictly individual perspective.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-03-2021-0149;It's my luck: impostor fears, the context, gender and achievement-related traits. Purpose Although the impostor phenomenon is attributed to childhood experiences, theory on achievement motivation indicates that achievement-related fears can also be elicited by the context. Using achievement goal theory as a base, the authors investigate the effect of context-dependent predictors, job-fit, career stage and organisational tenure, on impostor fears. The authors also examined gender and the achievement-related traits, self-efficacy and locus of control, as predictors of impostor fears to advance knowledge on antecedents to impostor fears. Design/methodology/approach Two studies were conducted with 270 and 280 participants, each. In Study 1, a subset of 12 respondents participated in follow-up interviews. Findings Impostor fears tended to be predicted by organisational tenure and career stage in both studies and job-fit in Study 1. Self-efficacy and locus of control predicted impostor fears. Men and women reported similar levels of impostor fears. Practical implications The authors demonstrate the importance of context in eliciting impostor fears and partially support initial descriptions of antecedents to impostor fears. The findings contribute to the development of targeted managerial practices that can help with the development of interventions, such as orientation programmes, that will enhance socialisation processes and mitigate impostor fears. Originality/value The literature on imposter fears has not addressed their situational predictors, which the authors argue are important elements in the genesis and maintenance of impostor fears. The authors draw on achievement goal theory to explain the pattern of findings related to key situational characteristics and their influence on imposter fears. The findings for Sri Lanka, on personality predictors, are similar to those reported in studies focused on North America providing evidence of cross-cultural applicability of the concept.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2021-0002;Workplace spirituality, well-being at work and employee loyalty in a gig economy: multi-group analysis across temporary vs permanent employment status. Purpose This study aims to examine the influence of workplace spirituality on employee loyalty toward the organization, mediated through well-being at work. Furthermore, the study endeavors to test the difference in conceptual model estimates, across two groups of employees: those who work on contract/temporary and permanent basis. The study gains relevance particularly in the context of the emerging sharing economy, where jobs are primarily characterized by short-term contracts and freelancing. Design/methodology/approach This descriptive study was conducted among a sample of 523 educators working in private educational institutions in India. Self-reporting questionnaires were administered among the respondents, who were selected through the purposive sampling method. Structural equation modeling and multi-group analysis were done to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings The analysis revealed that workplace spirituality enriched employee well-being and loyalty toward the organization and evidence were found for indirect effects too. Variances were observed in the relationships, with respect to the different employment statuses of the personnel. Significant differences in the relationships were not found across temporary and permanent employment statuses. Interestingly, temporary employees experienced stronger influences between meaningful work, well-being and word-of-mouth. Results suggest the relevance of understanding employees' differential work experiences and attitudes and thus facilitate human resource strategies accordingly. Originality/value This study is pioneering in conceptualizing and testing a theoretical model linking workplace spirituality, well-being at work and employee loyalty, particularly in the context of employees who differ in their employment status, which is a critical aspect of modern-day organizations. Unlike traditional workplaces, in recent times, people come together and work along for shorter terms, as the case of a sharing economy and the thus emergent interpersonal dynamics between each other and with the workplace has significant repercussions on the organization. Theoretical and managerial implications with regard to the experience of workplace spirituality and job outcomes are elaborated, thus striving to fill a gap in the existing literature.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Purpose The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the importance and influence of paternity leave on individual level organizational outcomes. Drawing on signaling theory, the study examines the relationship between paid paternity leave entitlement (PPLE) and organizational attractiveness (OA) through a mediating path of anticipated organizational support (AOS). Furthermore, the study proposes that this mediated relationship would be conditional on traditional masculinity ideology (TMI) such that the relationship would be stronger for individuals who score low on TMI. Design/methodology/approach The study analyzed a moderated mediation model using the data from a survey experiment. Data were collected from 264 professionals enrolled in an executive education course and will soon be looking for employment. Findings The findings supported the mediating role of AOS between PPLE and OA. As predicted, the positive impact of PPLE on AOS and OA is stronger for individuals scoring low on TMI. Originality/value This study takes a multidisciplinary approach to understand the underlying mechanisms that impact decisions related to employers. It is one of the few studies that study paternity leave in the Indian context and makes important contributions to theory and practice.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2024-0424;When families overload careers: the critical role of family-interferes-with-work and boundary management. Purpose - While there has been growing interest in how personal and work-related factors shape employees' careers, we know little about how family demands affect career intentions. Drawing from role theory and boundary theory, we examine the indirect effect of family-role overload on career intentions via family-interferes-with-work (FIW), as well as the conditional indirect effect of boundary management on these relationships. Design/methodology/approach - Utilizing two waves of panel data that were collected in the third and fourth waves of the pandemic in Canada (n = 433), we conducted a structural equation model to test our hypotheses. Findings - Our analysis reveals that FIW mediates the relationship between family-role overload and (1) career change intention and (2) job turnover intention. The results also indicate that the effect of family-role overload on career intentions via FIW strengthens for employees with a low ability to enact preferred boundaries. Originality/value - This research shows the indirect effect of family-role overload on career intentions via FIW. This research also highlights how boundary management can buffer the effects of family-role overload on career intentions.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2023-0835;The relationship between self-serving leadership and employees' expediency: a moderated mediation model. Purpose - Drawing upon social information processing theory, this study investigates the correlation between self-serving leadership and employee expediency. It also explores the mediating effect of self-interest motivation and the moderating effect of trait mindfulness. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 147 part-time MBA students were enlisted to participate in a scenario experiment (Study 1), and 291 valid employee questionnaires were collected through a multiple-time point survey (Study 2). SPSS 23.0, MPLUS 8.0 and PROCESS programs were used to analyze the data and test the hypotheses. Findings - Study 1 illustrated a positive correlation between self-serving leadership and employee expediency. It also identified self-interest motivation as a mediating factor in the correlation between self-serving leadership and expediency. Study 2 replicated the results obtained in Study 1 and expanded upon them by demonstrating that trait mindfulness moderates the association between self-serving leadership and self-interest motivation. Additionally, trait mindfulness moderates the indirect effect of self-serving leadership on expediency. Practical implications - This research argues that organizations should take steps to prevent self-serving leadership in order to reduce employee expediency. Furthermore, it is advisable to provide ethics training to employees who exhibit high trait mindfulness, as they show increased sensitivity to self-serving leadership and are more likely to engage in unethical behavior. Originality/value - This study expands the existing research on the ethical outcomes of self-serving leadership and contributes to a deeper understanding of the negative aspects of trait mindfulness.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

PurposeThe objective of this study is to analyze the process of reverse knowledge transfer (RKT) occurring in multinational companies (MNCs), examining whether headquarters' absorptive capacity and the human resource management (HRM) practices developed by the parent unit influence success.Design/methodology/approachThe data were collected through a questionnaire completed by the human resource manager of multinational company (MNC) headquarters. The analysis has been carried out on a sample of 115 Spanish MNCs by using structural equation models (SEM).FindingsThe results indicate that a parent firm's absorptive capacity positively influences RKT and that, in turn, this absorptive capacity is greater if headquarters implement certain practices of employee staffing, training, participation and performance appraisal.Originality/valueThis study extends existing research on RKT by examining the absorptive capacity of headquarters. Its main contribution is to provide evidence that MNCs can improve their RKT through HRM practices developed by the parent unit. This is original because most studies on RKT focus on HRM practices used by subsidiaries.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

PurposeThe purpose of the study was to maximize team members' collaboration and develop relationships in a newly formed team to engage with internal and external partners to achieve open innovation (OI) in product development. The authors examine the role of collaborative human resource management (HRM) and relational leadership (RL) in this process.Design/methodology/approachThe study took a two-stage qualitative methodological approach to examine relational leadership as it emerges in a newly formed cross-functional team at a large German fashion house. In stage one, 10 interviews were conducted with members of the new project team over three months and in stage two six external knowledge exchange partners were interviewed.FindingsCollaborative HRM promotes greater social exchange, trust and commitment of team members internal and external to the organization to support the emergence of RL, which is critical for OI. The authors found that collaborative HRM practices such as team-based recruitment, team-based training, team-based performance management with rewards systems and job design support the emergence of RL. Moreover, RL practices such as congruence and commitment towards team goals subsequently promoted the development of knowledge sourcing and sharing (KSS) to support OI.Originality/valueThe study is the first to demonstrate how collaborative HRM enables RL practices to help newly formed teams overcome challenges with achieving KSS to successfully engage with internal and external partners for OI. The authors contribute to HRM theory development of the relationship between HRM and OI by conceptualizing the OI process as a social construction through collaborative HRM and relational leadership.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-11-2022-0764;How employee pandemic fears may escalate into a lateness attitude, and how a safe organizational climate can mitigate this challenge. PurposeThis study aims to understand how and when employees' pandemic fears influence their lateness attitude, with a particular focus on how this influence is mediated by emotional exhaustion and moderated by a perceived safety climate.Design/methodology/approachSurvey data were collected among employees in the retail sector.FindingsA core mechanism that explains the escalation of pandemic fears into beliefs that tardiness is acceptable is employees' sense that employees are emotionally overextended by work. The extent to which employees perceive that their organization prioritizes safety issues subdues this detrimental process though.Practical implicationsFor human resource management (HRM) practice, the findings point to the notable danger that employees who cannot stop ruminating about an external crisis, and feel emotionally overburdened as a result, might compromise their own organizational standing by devoting less effort to punctuality. To disrupt this dynamic, HR managers can create organizational climates that emphasize safety practices.Originality/valueThis study adds to HRM research by revealing a pertinent source of personal adversity, pandemic fears, and how the fears affects tendencies to embrace tardiness at work. The study explicates how emotional exhaustion functions as a core conduit that connects this resource-draining condition with propensities to show up late, as well as how safety climate perceptions can buffer this translation.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2021-0234;Benevolent leadership and organizational citizenship behaviors in a higher education context: a moderated mediation model. PurposeDrawing upon the conservation of resources (COR) theory, this paper investigates the moderated mediation model linking benevolent leadership to organizational citizenship behaviors towards the organization (OCBO) and towards individuals (OCBI) in the context of higher education. The mediating roles of leader-member exchange and affective commitment as well as the moderating roles of the two attachment styles-attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance-are also examined.Design/methodology/approachData were collected from a sample of 333 university lecturers and analyzed using partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM).FindingsThe results demonstrate that leader-member exchange and affective commitment are mediating resources that help benevolent leaders motivate university lecturers to engage in two types of OCBs. Moreover, attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance act as the respective enhancer and inhibitor for the indirect effects of benevolent leadership on both OCBs through leader-member exchange. In contrast, the relationships between benevolent leadership and two types of OCBs through the mediating role of affective commitment are not contingent on the attachment styles of lecturers.Practical implicationsThe findings suggest that university leaders who aim at promoting OCBs among lecturers should deploy benevolent leadership style to facilitate a positive social exchange relationship as well as foster their affective commitment. Such leadership style is especially effective in influencing lecturers who possess attachment anxiety personality traits.Originality/valueThis pioneer research develops and empirically tests a COR theory-grounded moderated mediation model pertaining to benevolent leadership and lecturers' OCBs. The findings contribute to the educational management literature by demonstrating that benevolent leadership, a crucial organizational resource, significantly motivates lecturers' voluntary and extra-role behaviors in a dynamic and contingent manner. Leader-member exchange and affective commitment are important mediating resources in the process of transforming benevolent leadership into beneficial behaviors. Further, the effectiveness of benevolent leadership largely depends on lecturers' personality traits of attachment anxiety and avoidance. These novel mediating and moderating findings demonstrate the sequential and interaction effects of various organizational and individual resources on lecturers' OCBs;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2021-0031;Disentangling the elements of PsyCap as drivers for work, organization and social engagement in knowledge-intensive work. Purpose In response to a growing interest in worker well-being in a work-life which is experiencing fundamental transformations, this paper builds and tests a research model on the role of psychological capital (PsyCap) in three different forms of engagement at work. Engagement at work has been identified as one of the most significant drivers of successful work performance. Design/methodology/approach Using a quantitative research design, data were collected from 396 highly specialized knowledge workers through anonymous questionnaires. Research hypotheses were tested with linear models. Findings Analysis results indicate that all three forms of engagement are affected by PsyCap which consists of self-efficacy, resilience, hope and optimism, but the effect of individual dimensions is not the same for different forms of engagement at work. Practical implications It is argued that paying more attention to personal resources, such as the dimensions of PsyCap, and acknowledging diversity among individual workers offer possibilities for increasing employee performance. HR personnel can benefit organizational performance by boosting different dimensions of employees' PsyCap for different engagement purposes. Originality/value This paper takes a wider perspective on engagement at work, arguing that also organization engagement and social engagement, together with work engagement, are important factors for employee well-being and performance in work society.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Purpose - This study aims to examine the impact of managers' inclusive leadership (IL) on knowledge-sharing (KS) behavior. Additionally, the authors consider the cross-level moderation effect of diversity in the biological sex of employees on the relationship between IL and employee KS behaviors.Design/methodology/approach - A two-wave questionnaire survey was conducted in a large Japanese company. The sample included 827 employees (254 men and 573 women) in 129 groups. The authors, then, conducted a cross-level analysis using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM).Findings - IL promotes two types of KS among employees: knowledge donating (KD) and knowledge collecting (KC). Additionally, the moderating effects of employee biological-sex diversity on the relationship between IL and KS varied according to the KS type. IL had a positive effect on KD only in groups with higher biological-sex diversity, and did not affect groups with lower biological-sex diversity. Biological-sex diversity did not moderate the relationship between IL and KC.Practical implications - This study has practical implications, especially for personnel departments with high diversity in employees' biological sex. Further, to improve employees' KS behaviors, it may be important to develop managers' IL skills.Originality/value - This is the first study that explores the relationship between IL and KS and the first to provide evidence of the moderating effect of diversity of employee's biological sex.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2021-0313;Personnel Review at age 50: a retrospective using bibliometric analysis. Purpose Personnel Review (PR) is a leading human resource management journal. The article endeavors to provide a retrospective of the journal to commemorate the journal's 50th anniversary. Design/methodology/approach The article employs a variety of bibliometric analysis techniques such as performance analysis, co-authorship analysis, bibliographic coupling, and negative binomial regression to provide a retrospective of PR. Findings The performance analysis suggests that PR has grown steadily in PR's publications and citations. Though most of PR's contributions originate from Europe, a geographical shift toward global contributions has been witnessed in recent years. Besides that, a culture of collaboration among PR authors has manifested and proliferated over time. Though a third of European studies are qualitative and more than 90% of Asian studies are quantitative, PR studies, as a whole, are moving away from conceptual and qualitative to empirical and quantitative research. Next, the bibliographic coupling of the PR corpus indicates five major themes-namely, human resource management policies and practices;art; strategic human resource management;" and organizational culture and workplace environment. Finally, the negative binomial regression reveals that article age, abstract and article length and number of keywords and references significantly drive PR citations.

10.1108/PR-03-2021-0176;How the supervisor's Machiavellianism results in abusive supervision: understanding the role of the supervisor's competitive worldviews and subordinate's performance. Purpose Drawing on the dual process model of ideology and prejudice, the purpose of this paper is to examine whether, how and when a supervisor's Machiavellianism leads to subordinates' perceptions of abusive supervision. In doing so, the authors also explore the mediating role of the supervisor's competitive world views and the moderating role of subordinates' performance on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach The theoretical model was tested using three sources of data from supervisors, their subordinates and the organization. Hierarchical linear model analysis was run on supervisor and subordinate dyadic data for testing whether subordinates' performance moderated the mediated relationships or not. Findings The results suggest that the supervisors' competitive worldviews explain the positive link between their Machiavellianism and subordinates' perceptions of abusive supervision. The results highlight that the mediation effect of supervisors' competitive worldviews on the link between their Machiavellianism and their subordinates' perceptions of abusive supervision is more pronounced when subordinates' performance is low than when it is high. Research limitations/implications This research contributes to the authors' knowledge of the link between supervisors' Machiavellianism and abusive supervision, and how the toxic influence of their Machiavellianism is mediated by supervisors' competitive worldviews. Originality/value The study contributes to the literature on abusive supervision and personality by studying the role of personality as an antecedent of abusive supervision.

Purpose This study aims to examine the moderating effects of psychological entitlement and perceived organizational support (POS) on the relationship between work connectivity behavior after-hours (WCBA) and job satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 217 full-time employees of an Internet company in China at two points in time separated by about one month. Hierarchical regression and simple slope analyses were conducted to test hypotheses. Findings The results showed that WCBA was negatively related to job satisfaction and that this relationship could be mitigated by POS. Moreover, psychological entitlement aggravated this relationship, and this aggravating effect was stronger when POS was at low levels. Practical implications Managers should avoid intervening employees' nonwork domains too much. If this is unavoidable, managers should provide adequate organizational support to help employees cope with the challenges brought by WCBA. Besides, managers need to pay close attention to highly entitled employees and take measures to modify their expectations. Originality/value First, this study enriches the understanding of what WCBA is and how WCBA works by investigating the influencing mechanism of WCBA from the perspectives of effort-reward imbalance and job demands-resources. Second, by verifying the moderating effects of psychological entitlement and POS, this study provides insights into the boundaries of the WCBA-job satisfaction relationship. Third, this study contributes to the literature on psychological entitlement by identifying its one applicable condition.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2020-0495;Service-oriented human resource practices and customer outcomes: the service-profit chain perspective. Purpose Based on the service-profit chain perspective, this study investigates whether service-oriented human resource practices can enhance customer outcomes through motivational mechanisms (i.e. intrinsic/extrinsic satisfaction) as well as emotional mechanisms (i.e. emotional labor strategies). Design/methodology/approach This study collected paired data from 220 service workers and their customers at different time points from 80 service firms. Multilevel path-analysis was conducted to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings Our results indicate that firm-level extensive training is positively related to service workers' intrinsic job satisfaction, which in turn increases deep acting. In addition, firm-level incentive compensation is positively associated with service workers' extrinsic job satisfaction, which in turn reduces surface acting. Finally, service employee's deep acting enhances customer loyalty and willingness to recommend via customer satisfaction. Practical implications The service organization should (1) stress the importance of incentive compensation to decrease surface acting via enhancing extrinsic job satisfaction and (2) provide extensive service training to improve service employees' intrinsic satisfaction and deep acting, leading to favorable customer outcomes. Originality/value The present study identifies the critical roles of motivational and emotional mechanisms in transferring service-oriented human resource practices to customer outcomes and employing rigorous research design to enhance the internal/external validity of our findings.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2020-0330;How work-life conflict affects employee outcomes of Chinese only-children academics: the moderating roles of gender and family structure. Purpose China's controversial one-child policy has been blamed for creating an ageing population, a generation of employees without siblings and a 4-2-1 family structure that places eldercare responsibility, primarily on women. Current understanding of how this affects contemporary employees' work-life interface is lacking. This study examined the moderating roles of family structure and gender in the relationships between work-life conflict (WLC), job satisfaction and career aspiration for university academics. Design/methodology/approach Online and self-administered surveys were used to collect data, which involved 420 academic staff in three Chinese research universities. Findings Our results revealed that WLC is positively related to career aspiration, and this relationship is stronger for academics with siblings and, within the only-children group, significantly stronger for women than for men. WLC is also negatively related to job satisfaction, and this relationship is stronger for only-children academics. Research limitations/implications Results were limited by a cross-sectional sample of modest size. Nevertheless, this study contributes to the understanding of gender roles and changing family structure in the work-life interface of Chinese academics. Practical implications Our findings have implications for both universities seeking to improve staff well-being and for wider society. A number of support mechanisms are proposed to enhance the ability of only children, especially women, to operate as effective members of the labour market. Originality/value Our results showed that only-children academics face a unique set of difficulties across career and family domains, which have been previously neglected in literature.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-08-2019-0450;The sharing economy and the transformation of work: evidence from Foodora. Purpose This article explores the various stakeholders' perceptions of the ways digital work is organised within the sharing economy and the social implications of the transformation of work. Design/methodology/approach Applying social media analytics (SMA) concerning the sharing economy platform Foodora, a total of 3,251 user-generated content was collected and organised throughout the social media landscape in Sweden over 12 months, and 18 stakeholder groups were identified, discussing digital work within seven thematic categories. Findings The results show that the stakeholder groups in the Swedish context primarily expressed negative views of Foodora's way of organising digital work. The social media posts outlined the distributive and procedural justice related to the working conditions, boycott and protests and critical incidents, as well as the collective bargaining of Foodora. Originality/value By utilising a novel SMA method, this study contributes to the extant literature on the sharing economy by providing a systematic assessment concerning the impact of the sharing economy platform on the transformation of work and the associated social consequences.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2023-0466;Instagram for recruiting: a content analysis and effects of information and interactions in hiring-related Instagram posts. PurposeThis study aims to understand how organizations use social media for recruitment by identifying (1) what type of information is promoted and (2) what type of engagement and interaction occurs in hiring-related Instagram posts. Moreover, drawing on the social media affordance approach, this study further examines whether certain information and interactions in Instagram posts lead to better outcomes.Design/methodology/approachUsing a hashtag-based sampling strategy, we conducted a content analysis of 274 hiring-related Instagram posts by organizations to identify different types of information and interaction and then conducted a series of t-tests to examine the impact of the observed information and interactions on outcomes.FindingsWe found four types of hiring-related information and identified ten types of interactions driven by both organizations and audiences. Additionally, we found that hiring-related Instagram posts with a high degree of visibility and association led to more likes and comments.Practical implicationsThis study's results can benefit organizations that use Instagram to attract jobseekers and potential applicants, as different types of information and interaction lead to different outcomes.Originality/valueSince this is the first study to content analyze Instagram posts associated with hiring, it will provide important implications for both practice and research.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-12-2022-0894;Compulsory citizenship behavior, role overload, creativity and service-oriented voluntary behavior: does generational difference have an impact?. PurposeThis study investigates how compulsory citizenship behaviors (CCB) affect employees' energy and motivation to engage in other voluntary behaviors, such as service-oriented citizenship behavior and creativity. Specifically, we explore how employees' perceptions of job overload mediate this relationship, based on their generational differences.Design/methodology/approachThis study employed a time-lagged survey design to collect data from 265 frontline employees and their supervisors in Pakistani-based organizations. The data was collected in three rounds, with a three-week gap between each round.FindingsThe findings suggest that role overload, resulting from compulsory citizenship pressure, undermines millennial employees' service-oriented organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) and creativity. However, these negative effects are less salient among non-millennials.Practical implicationsThe findings of this study provide valuable insights for managers, emphasizing the importance of exercising caution when imposing excessive citizenship pressures on employees against their will. In addition, organizations and human resource (HR) managers should consider devising policies for formal recognition of voluntary behaviors that contribute to organizational effectiveness.Originality/valueThis study contributes to existing CCB research by unraveling the previously unexplored mediating role of role overload and the contingency role of generational difference in explaining how and when coerced citizenship demands hinder employees' propensity to engage in service-oriented OCB and creativity.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2022-0313;The curvilinear relationships between perceived development human resource practices and both affective commitment and work stress: the moderating effects of age. PurposeThis paper aims to reveal the curvilinear relationships between perceived development human resource practices (DHRPs) and both affective commitment and work stress, and the moderating effects of age on the curvilinear relationships.Design/methodology/approachHypotheses were developed from an employee-oriented contingent view based on the person-job fit theory and lifespan development theories. Methods suggested by Haans et al. (2016) and Dawson (2014) to test curvilinear relationships and related moderations, and a two-wave survey data from 742 Chinese employees were used.FindingsThe results showed that perceived DHRPs related to affective commitment in an inverted U shape and work stress in a U shape. However, age moderated the nature of the relationships such that both the curvilinear relationships only existed under low age while under high age perceived DHRPs related to affective commitment positively and work stress negatively.Originality/valueThis study advances the prevailing linear (positive or negative) thinking on the DHRPs-outcomes relationships by showing that perceived DHRPs relate to both affective commitment and work stress nonlinearly. Moreover, different from existing findings that age moderates the strength of the linear DHRPs-outcomes relationships, the results indicate that age moderates the nature of the relationships between perceived DHRPs and affective commitment and work stress. This implies a refined age-differential approach to use DHRPs to sustain a committed and healthy workforce in the context of workforce aging.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-03-2023-0174;Employing people who have been there, experienced that to inform innovative HRM responses to workforce mental health issues: practice insights from industry. PurposeThis case documents an innovative human resource management (HRM) practice adopted by an Australian organization in the energy sector, purposefully introducing lived experience informed mental health advocate (MHA) roles into the organization, to address pressing mental health workforce issues. MHA roles provide experiential, first-hand knowledge of experiencing mental health issues, offering a novel, common-sense and impactful perspective on supporting employees with mental health challenges.ApproachData that informed this case came from desktop research using publicly available resources, as well as a series of conversations with four key stakeholders in the organization. This approach allowed insights into Energy Queensland's journey towards establishing novel MHA roles to delineate the day-to-day work practice of these roles.Contribution to PracticeThis is a novel HRM practice that has only recently emerged outside of the mental health sector. We discuss key considerations that enabled the success of the roles, including taking an evolutionary perspective, obtaining support from senior executives and relevant stakeholders, making a long-term financial commitment, and providing autonomy and flexibility in role design. This is the first article that documents this innovative practice to offer new insights to HRM scholars, as well as practical guidelines to other organizations in addressing workforce mental health issues.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-03-2023-0198;How does AI-enabled HR analytics influence employee resilience: job crafting as a mediator and HRM system strength as a moderator. PurposeBased on the JD-R model and process-focused HRM perspective, this research paper aims to investigate the processes underlying the relationship between AI-enabled HR analytics and employee well-being outcomes (resilience) that received less attention in the AI-driven HRM literature. Specifically, this study aims to examine the indirect effect between AI-enabled HR analytics and employee resilience via job crafting, moderated by HRM system strength to highlight the contextual stimulus of AI-enabled HR analytics.Design/methodology/approachThe authors adopted a time-lagged research design (one-month interval) to test the proposed hypotheses. The authors used two-wave surveys to collect data from 175 full-time hotel employees in China.FindingsThe findings indicated that employees' perceptions of AI-enabled HR analytics enhance their resilience. This study also found the mediation role of job crafting in the mentioned relationship. Moreover, the positive effects of AI-enabled HR analytics on employee resilience amplify in the presence of a strong HRM system.Practical implicationsOrganizations that aim to utilize AI-enabled HR analytics to achieve organizational missions should also dedicate attention to its associated employee well-being outcomes.Originality/valueThis study enriched the literature with regard to AI-driven HRM in that it identifies the mediating role of job crafting and the moderating role of HRM system strength in the relationship between AI-enabled HR analytics and employee resilience.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-09-2022-0635;Managing team interdependence to address the Great Resignation. PurposeHybrid and virtual work settings offer greater flexibility and autonomy, yet they also have the paradoxical effect of weakening the connection of employees to each other and their identification with the organization. The purpose of this article is to discuss how to manage this paradox effectively. Design/methodology/approachLeveraging structural adaptation theory, the authors discuss hybrid and virtual work as one of five dimensions of team interdependence that collectively determine the tightness of coupling between team members.FindingsThe authors propose that the introduction of virtual and hybrid work can lead to a lower sense of belonging and identification with the organization that would need to be counteracted by respective increases in team interdependence in one or several of the remaining dimensions of team interdependence.Originality/valueThe authors apply research on team interdependence to develop a series of practical interventions that can address the Great Resignation. These interventions seek to enhance employees' experiences of belongingness after the shift to virtual and hybrid work. In doing so, the authors provide a toolkit that organizations can leverage to improve their employees' experiences in a post-COVID-19 workplace.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2022-0068;Does HPWS amplify employees' change readiness for digital transformation? A study through the work-from-anywhere prism. PurposeThis study intends to advance the research on the relationship between high-performance work systems (HPWS) and change readiness by examining the mediating role of positive employee outcomes. Therefore, the streams of strategic human resource management (SHRM) and change management are studied in the context of digital transformation in the post-COVID-19 pandemic scenario.Design/methodology/approachPrimary responses from 409 Information Technology (IT) employees were analysed to investigate the mediating relationship between HPWS, positive employee outcomes and employee readiness to change. Researchers used statistical techniques to analyse the data, such as confirmatory factor analysis, correlations, regression and bootstrapping. In addition, sequential mediation was examined using PROCESS Macro and syntax for SPSS.FindingsResults of the study revealed that implementation of HPWS through extensive training and development, performance-based appraisal and compensation, participation in decision-making, flexible work arrangements and rigorous recruitment and staffing results in enhanced employee-level outcomes. Thereby conclusively impacting their readiness to change for digital transformations.Practical implicationsThis study revisits the elements of HPWS in the post-pandemic work-from-anywhere (WFA) scenario. Thus, it provides adequate indications that investment in designing bundles of change-oriented human resource (HR) practices amplifies the chances of success of a change initiative by creating a favourable mindset and attitude among IT employees in India.Originality/valueThis study is among the earliest to link two major streams of SHRM and change management by establishing HPWS as an essential antecedent of a change-related outcome by introducing multiple mediators in the sequence. This sequence provides new insights for enhancing the probability of organisational change directives succeeding.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2022-0072;Work-from-home (WFH): the constraints-coping-effectiveness framework. Purpose Work-from-home (WFH) arrangement is implemented to enable employees to achieve work-life balance. However, WFH arrangement can be less than ideal. This study developed a WFH framework using qualitative data. Design/methodology/approach An open-ended survey was conducted and participated by 621 employees. The data were examined using the qualitative content analysis method. Findings Work performance and personal well-being have been identified as WFH outcomes, and 12 relevant research propositions have been developed. Constraints to WFH effectiveness include household and organisational factors whilst instrumental and emotional support were identified as the facilitating conditions. Two moderators were also identified: temporal flexibility and commitment orientation. Research limitations/implications This study provides a framework that support effective implementation of WFH and similar flexible work arrangements. Managing time, situation, emotions and attitudes are coping strategies used by WFH employees, and the efficacy of these strategies needs further empirical investigation. Practical implications Three main factors have been identified as significant in determining WFH effectiveness. Understanding these elements can help managers design solutions to help employees manage work-home boundaries, improving their work performance and well-being. Originality/value The Constraints-Coping-Effectiveness WFH framework and research propositions help organisations build WFH guidelines and policies. This study also recognises commitment orientation, which links resources, strategies and outcomes. The inclusion of this variable in future empirical studies could explain the gaps in the current literature.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-12-2020-0879;Profiling employee psychological responses during restructuring and downsizing in the public sector: Flourishers, Recoverers and Ambivalents. Purpose This study aims to examine configurations of person-centered psychological change during organizational restructuring and downsizing in a public sector setting. Drawing on a social cognitive framework of organizational change the authors explore and identify the existence of different groups of employees who demonstrate varied responses (on commitment, engagement and anxiety) to restructuring and downsizing. Design/methodology/approach Surveys were collected from employees in three longitudinal waves (Time 1 N = 253;art; higher structural uncertainty predicted membership of the most negative response group. Practical implications Using a person-centered approach, the authors form an understanding of different types of employee responses to downsizing;" along with potential factors that help explain why groups of employees may exhibit certain psychological response patterns and may need to be managed differently during change. Thus, this approach provides greater understanding to researchers and managers of the varied impact that restructuring/downsizing has on the workforce. Originality/value To date there has been little research exploring employee responses to organizational restructuring and downsizing that has attempted to take a person-centered approach, which assumes population heterogeneity. Unlike variable centered approaches, this unique approach helps identify different patterns of employee responses to restructuring and downsizing."",art";;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2021-0281;The impact of abusive supervision differentiation on team performance in team competitive climates. Purpose This paper aims to explore the mechanism underlying the relationship between abusive supervision differentiation (ASD) and team performance. The moderating roles of inter-team and intra-team competitive climate are also examined. Design/methodology/approach This research collects data from 419 employees and 71 supervisors from hospitals and financial companies in China. Techniques include descriptive statistics and hierarchical multiple regression are applied to analyze the data. Findings This research finds that (1) team relationship conflict mediated the relationship between ASD and team performance and (2) intra-team competitive climate strengthened the indirect relationship between ASD and team performance through team relationship conflict. Practical implications The results indicate that organizations should take measures to minimize the occurrence of abusive supervision. Team leaders should increase self-control and avoid abusing employees. Furthermore, organizations should establish an open and fair reward and punishment system to avoid cutthroat competition. Originality/value This study advances our knowledge of how ASD results in poor team effectiveness. This contributes to the literature by identifying team relationship conflict as a mediating mechanism linking the negative association of ASD with team performance. Additionally, competitive climate enriches the individual-focused team-level model of abusive supervision.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2021-0091;A cross-industry comparison of how women leaders experience gender bias. Purpose This paper compares how women leaders in four US industries-higher education, faith-based non-profits, healthcare and law-experience 15 aspects of gender bias. Design/methodology/approach This study used convergent mixed methods to collect data from 1,606 participants. It included quantitative assessment of a validated gender bias scale and qualitative content analysis of open-ended responses. Findings Results suggest that, while gender bias is prevalent in all four industries, differences exist. Participants in higher education experienced fewer aspects of gender bias than the other three industries related to male culture, exclusion, self-limited aspirations, lack of sponsorship and lack of acknowledgement. The faith-based sample reported the highest level of two-person career structure but the lowest levels of queen bee syndrome, workplace harassment and salary inequality. Healthcare tended towards the middle, reporting higher scores than one industry and lower than another while participants working in law experienced more gender bias than the other three industries pertaining to exclusion and workplace harassment. Healthcare and law were the two industries with the most similar experiences of bias. Originality/value This research contributes to human resource management (HRM) literature by advancing understanding of how 15 different gender bias variables manifest differently for women leaders in various industry contexts and by providing HRM leaders with practical steps to create equitable organizational cultures.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2021-0224;Delivering well-being through the coronavirus pandemic: the role of human resources (HR) in managing a healthy workforce. Purpose This paper examines how human resources (HR) professionals in the UK have supported employee wellbeing during the coronavirus disease (COVID) pandemic. It considers the extent to which HR professionals were prepared for the crisis and their readiness in supporting the wellbeing of their people. Design/methodology/approach Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 senior HR professionals working across the public and private sectors in the UK. Using an in-depth interview structure, the research explored how respondents both reacted to and managed the crisis in their respective organisations. Template analysis was used to analyse the data allowing a certain degree of fluidity in the establishment of ordered relationships between the themes. Findings This study finds that business continuity plans turned out to be useless during the pandemic because they focussed on data, not people. It highlights the tension between home-working and burn-out as online presenteeism increased due to staff changing their behaviour in response to self-surveillance. The paper emphasises the importance of soft skills and authentic leadership and the tensions in respect of equity. Research limitations/implications The study was conducted with HR professionals in the UK, not internationally. Although the sample did include HR professionals from across the public, private and third sectors, the experience may not be representative of all those working in HR. Originality/value This research found that those organisations that had engaged in business continuity planning prior to the pandemic focussed on the retrieval and accessibility of data rather than people. This prioritises staff as a resource rather than emphasising people as an organisation's most valuable asset. Furthermore, the study found that staff worked harder and for longer periods of time as a consequence of self-imposed surveillance. Organisational responses were contradictory as despite implementing well-being strategies to promote physical and mental health, there was little evidence of an effective response to this online presenteeism.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-03-2020-0200;The impact of workplace loneliness on employee outcomes: what role does psychological capital play?. Purpose With little empirical attention devoted to the consequences of loneliness in the workplace, the present study investigated the effect of workplace loneliness on creative performance, organizational citizenship behaviors and work-family family conflict. Furthermore, psychological capital was examined as a moderator of these relationships. Design/methodology/approach The proposed model was tested in two different studies on a sample of employees from manufacturing (Sample 1: n = 379) and service (Sample 2: n = 559) organizations in India. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaires at two different points in time. Confirmatory factor analysis and multiple hierarchical regressions were used to test the hypothesized model. Findings While workplace loneliness was found to negatively affect creative performance and organizational citizenship behavior, its impact on work-family conflict was positive. Results revealed a significant moderating effect of psychological capital on these relationships. Psychological capital buffered the impact of loneliness in a way that the detrimental effect of loneliness on performance behaviors was less severe for the individuals with high psychological capital. Originality/value The study makes an original and noteworthy contribution to the loneliness and negative emotions literature by advancing the understanding around the consequences and boundary conditions of loneliness in the workplace. It carries important implications for managing loneliness in the organizations by identifying psychological capital as an important personal resource for mitigating the effects of workplace loneliness on creativity and extra-role behaviors.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2020-0489;Thwarted psychological needs: the negative impact of customer mistreatment on service employees and the moderating role of empowerment HRM practices. Purpose Drawing on self-determination theory (SDT), this study aims to understand the adverse effects of customer mistreatment on employee performance and well-being by thwarting the satisfaction of employees' basic psychological needs. It also examines how these negative effects may be mitigated by empowerment human resource management (HRM) practices. Design/methodology/approach Two studies were conducted using survey data collected in China. In Study 1, cross-sectional data from 321 telemarketing employees were analyzed to examine how customer mistreatment reduces the satisfaction of employees' basic psychological needs, harming job performance and job satisfaction. In Study 2, multiwave, multisource data were collected from 149 property agents and their supervisors to replicate the findings of Study 1 and further test empowerment HRM as a moderator of the relationship between customer mistreatment and satisfaction of needs. Findings The results from both studies show that customer mistreatment leads to low job performance and job satisfaction via reduced satisfaction of employees' needs for autonomy and competence but not relatedness. Moreover, the negative effect on the satisfaction of employees' needs for autonomy and competence was buffered when organizations had high empowerment HRM practices in place. Originality/value This study provides new insights on customer mistreatment by understanding its effects from a motivational perspective, which has not been considered in prior research. It also explores how HRM practices can help satisfy employee needs in adverse work environments induced by customer mistreatment.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22213;Do women perceive incivility from men as selective? Examining main effects, coping responses, and boundary conditions. Women are more likely than men to be targets of incivility in the workplace. Scholars have referred to this pattern as selective incivility and suggest that incivility directed toward women-that is, selective incivility-is a form of modern sexism in the workplace. However, it remains unclear whether women themselves make sense of incivility from men as a form of gender bias, and when such perceptions shape whether women engage in unique responses to incivility perceived as selective. Drawing on social identity theory, we develop a conceptual model to better understand these relationships. Across two studies with working women, we show that women perceive male-instigated incivility as selective. Further, our findings show that women are more likely to engage in problem-focused-responses (i.e., direct confrontation and formal reporting), rather than emotion-focused responses (i.e., avoidance) in response to incivility perceived as selective and that these coping responses are, at times, moderated by the frequency of incivility. Overall, our research advances the literature on incivility, selective incivility, and gender bias at work, offers practical implications for managers seeking to foster workplace inclusion, and suggests novel directions for future research.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22214;Employee voice in times of crisis: A conceptual framework exploring the role of Human Resource practices and Human Resource system strength. Despite extensive developments in the field of Human Resource Management, we still have limited and fragmented knowledge of how the external and internal environment of an organization influences direct employee voice. In this conceptual paper, we draw on signaling theory and theorize on whether and, if so, how direct employee voice and organizational voice climate are shaped at times of macro and organizational turbulence. Specifically, we introduce the concepts of solidary, utilitarian, and opportunistic crisis-related Human Resource (HR) practices and propose that they send different signals to employees, influencing their voice perceptions in distinctive ways. We also theorize that employees interpret these signals vis-a-vis the experienced meso- and macroturbulence, a process that affects HR system strength and the subsequent formulation of voice perceptions and voice climate emergence. With this work, we contribute to the voice and strategic HR literature by offering an integrated and multilayered understanding of how top-down processes at turbulent times such as crisis-related HR practices can influence bottom-up emergent phenomena.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22204;Blinded by algo economicus: Reflecting on the assumptions of algorithmic management research to move forward. This paper reflects on the paradigmatic assumptions and ideologies that have shaped algorithmic management research. We identify two sets of assumptions: one about the ontology of algorithms (which holds that human resource management [HRM] algorithms are non-human entities with material agency) and one about the ontology of management that HRM algorithms afford (which understands algorithmic management as a form of control for maximizing economic/shareholder value). We explain how these core assumptions underpin existing research of HRM algorithms, causing blind spots that hinder new ways of understanding and studying algorithmic management. After identifying and unpacking the assumptions and blind spots, we offer avenues to overcome these blind spots, allowing for future research based on new ideological assumption grounds that will help move algorithmic management scholarship further in significant ways.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22187;Beyond employer brand content: The role of employer brand process attributes in understanding employees' reactions toward their employer. Employees play a central role in organizational functioning and representation. HR managers thus strive to create an attractive employer image that stimulates employees' attachment and ambassadorship. However, presently, there is limited research about how employees perceive and react toward their organization's employer brand. More importantly, the studies available have focused on content attributes only (i.e., instrumental and symbolic image dimensions). This has resulted in limited (content-based) understanding of the construct and failure to incorporate its branding-related aspects (process attributes) which represent the crux of employer branding theory. Thus, using the HRM system strength theory and employer branding literature, this article examines three process characteristics (i.e., employer brand distinctiveness, consistency, and consensus) vis-a-vis instrumental and symbolic content attributes to understand employee reactions (i.e., employer attractiveness, organizational identification, and employee ambassadorship). Data were collected at two times through Prolific Academic with 254 UK and US employees. Results suggest that employer brand process attributes are valuable sources to enhance employees' identification with their organization. Moreover, distinctiveness and consistency seem especially instrumental in enhancing employees' attractiveness perceptions and display of positive ambassadorship. In addition, the process attributes explain significant incremental and unique variance beyond content attributes in employee reactions.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22153;Sustainable human resource management practices, employee resilience, and employee outcomes: Toward common good values. Extant literature has generated limited understanding of whether and how sustainable human resource management (HRM) will lead to better and more sustainable outcomes, such as enhanced employee well-being and improved employee performance. Moving toward common good values and drawing on the job demands-resources model, this study theorizes and tests the relationships among sustainable HRM practices, employee resilience, work engagement, and employee performance. The empirical results of a multilevel and multisource study in the Chinese context provide supporting evidence for our theoretical model. The findings demonstrate that sustainable HRM practices positively affect employee resilience, and lead to a high level of work engagement among employees. Employee resilience also has an indirect effect on employee performance through work engagement. This study, with its theoretical and practical implications, reveals a serial mediation mechanism through which sustainable HRM practices contribute to both employee well-being and employee performance.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22138;Arousing employee pro-environmental behavior: A synergy effect of environmentally specific transformational leadership and green human resource management. Employee proactive pro-environmental behavior (PEB) has been increasingly emphasized as an essential behavior benefiting the environment and organizational sustainability. Nevertheless, both scholars and practitioners need a fuller yet nuanced understanding of the antecedents and boundary condition of PEB. Drawing from theories of cue consistency and proactivity, we advance an interaction perspective to explain how environmentally specific transformational leadership (ESTL) as guidance and green human resource management (GHRM) as normative practices interact to arouse employee PEB and how three fine-grained proactive psychological states of green self-efficacy, environmental self-accountability, and environmental passion transmit these effects. Two lab experiments constructively offered causal support for our main hypotheses, and a multilevel, multiphase, and multisource field study verified our integrative model and enhanced the generalizability of conclusions. Results indicated that in addition to the direct positive effects, organization-level GHRM, and individual-level ESTL also showed a synergy effect in predicting employee PEB. Three differentiated proactive psychological states positively linked the underlying processes, especially in the high-GHRM context. The findings highlight a multilevel antecedent framework of employee PEB and provide a useful attempt to answer the lingering debate about interactions between leadership and human resource management systems.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22258;The Double Empathy Problem and Person-Environment Fit: Mutual Understanding and Bidirectional Adjustment in Autistic Talent Acquisition. Organizations are starting to actively invest in hiring initiatives aimed at recruiting autistic talent. However, given many of these initiatives are in their infancy, knowledge of autism and how best to assess and support autistic employees is low. Building on person-environment fit (P-E fit) theory and the double empathy problem, we examine how neurodiversity employment programs build mutual understanding and construct fit between autistic employees and their hiring organizations. We further explore the role of third-party neurodivergent talent consultants (NTCs) in aiding these efforts during the birth stage of the cycle of talent. In Study 1, we use action research involving in-depth structured interviews of participants (managers, coaches, and autistic employees) in a neurodiversity employment program at a major corporation in the financial services industry, supplemented with additional interviews of hiring managers and coaches with similar roles in other organizational settings. In Study 2, we collect qualitative survey data from autistic adults participating in other neurodiversity employment programs. Using these data, we explicate the practices that remove barriers to autistic employment and processes of ongoing coaching and support from NTCs that build and manage the double empathy problem by enhancing mutual understanding and increasing the perceptions of fit. We find that NTCs facilitate the acquisition of autistic talent through revised job search and recruitment (e.g., tailored job descriptions), alternative screening procedures (e.g., hands-on assessments), and supported socialization and onboarding (e.g., communication, networking).;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Workplace nepotism, the preferential treatment based on kinship or familial ties, is a pervasive phenomenon that permeates every corner of our global workforce, transcending cultures, countries, industries, and organizations. Despite its ubiquitous presence, research on nepotism remains fragmented and scattered, with diverse disciplines seldom converging or cross-referencing one another. In this integrative review, we synthesize, integrate, and critically assess the extant body of knowledge about workplace nepotism. Our aim is to provide HR scholars with a panoramic view of the known, the unknown, and the uncharted territories to move the field forward. To this end, we first provide a clear conceptualization of nepotism, setting it apart from closely related constructs. Second, we offer a comprehensive review of empirical evidence that summarizes the antecedents, consequences, and theoretical foundations of nepotism. Importantly, our review adopts an actor-centric perspective, advocating that three main sets of actors are meaningfully involved in nepotism (i.e., instigators, beneficiaries, and third parties), thereby contributing to theory by showing that nepotism may differentially relate to outcomes depending on which actor's perspective is taken. Third, we identify the shortcomings related to theory, methods, and measures, while identifying best practices. In particular, we offer insights into how future scholarship may meaningfully extend this literature. Finally, we provide evidence-based guidelines for how organizations and their leaders may develop and refine their policies regarding the hiring, promotion, evaluation, and compensation of family members and relatives.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22228;Having fun and thriving: The impact of fun human resource practices on employees' autonomous motivation and thriving at work. Research interest in thriving at work has burgeoned over the past decades, but little is known about how human resource (HR) practices affect employees' thriving at work. Drawing upon self-determination theory and person-organization fit theory, we developed and tested a moderated mediation model to explain how fun HR practices influence employees' thriving at work. The results of two studies, a scenario experiment (N = 164) and a time-lagged survey (N = 253), supported our hypotheses. Specifically, the findings revealed that fun HR practices relates positively to employees' thriving at work. Autonomous motivation partially mediates the abovementioned relationship. Furthermore, fun HR practices translate into higher autonomous motivation and subsequent thriving at work for employees with higher preference for workplace fun. Our research contributes to the existing literature by identifying fun HR practices as an antecedent of thriving at work and revealing the psychological mechanisms through which fun HR practices affect employees' thriving at work. The practical implications, limitations, and future research avenues are also discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22167;Work-role overload, work-life conflict, and perceived career plateau: The moderating role of emotional stability. As perceived career plateau is a prevalent but undesirable state which is harmful to employees and organizations, human resource management (HRM) research has devoted efforts to exploring ways of managing it. However, to date, research has largely been limited to variables that reduce perceived career plateau. There is a need to understand what factors increase these perceptions and how/when they do so, to advance theoretical and practical perspectives. This study contributes to the career plateau literature by investigating how and under what conditions work-role overload can increase employees' perceived career plateau (hierarchical and job content plateaus). Based on a three-wave survey of employees from the service sector of China, we found that work-role overload interacted with employees' trait emotional stability and affected their work-life conflict, which had downstream implications on the two types of perceived career plateaus. Specifically, work-role overload related positively to work-life conflict only when employees had a high (versus low) level of emotional stability. Also, work-life conflict mediated the effects of work-role overload on perceived hierarchical and job content plateaus for employees with high, but not for those with low, emotional stability. These findings provide new insights into how, by taking into account stressful work contexts and individual differences, HRM professionals may intervene to prevent employees from perceiving career plateau.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22154;The self-regulatory consequences of dependence on intelligent machines at work: Evidence from field and experimental studies. Organizations are increasingly augmenting employee jobs with intelligent machines. Although this augmentation has a bright side, in terms of its ability to enhance employee performance, we think there is likely a dark side as well. Draw from self-regulation theory, we theorize that dependence on intelligent machines is discrepancy-reducing-enhancing work goal progress, which in turn boosts employees' task performance. On the other hand, such dependence may be discrepancy-enlarging-threatening employee self-esteem, which in turn detracts from employees' task performance. Drawing further from self-regulation theory, we submit that employees' core self-evaluation (CSE) may influence these effects of dependence on intelligent machines. Across an experience-sampling field study conducted in India (Study 1) and a simulation-based experiment conducted in the United States (Study 2), our results generally support a mixed blessing  perspective of intelligent machines at work. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of our work.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22108;Store leader gender and store sales performance: When and why do women and men underperform?. Finding ways of breaking the gender-based glass ceiling is an important human resource issue in companies today. Employing a sample of over 200 retail stores, we explore multiple moderating and mediating factors to explain when and why women store leaders perform better, equal to, or worse than men. Results reveal that (a) women are assigned to lead stores that are positioned closer to competitive rivals than men and (b) women receive unfair distributive pay outcomes in that they are generally paid less than their male counterparts. When accounting for these factors, performance (i.e., productivity) differences between stores with men and women leaders diminished. Further, organizational tenure and store-unit size (i.e., number of employees) were positively associated with sales performance among stores with women leaders. The findings unveil why some store-units led by women underperform but also offer contingency factors that delineate when women-led and men-led stores excel in sales productivity. Implications for recruiting and retaining both women and men in leadership are considered.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22091;The road taken and the path forward for HR devolution research: An evolutionary review. Devolving HR responsibilities to the line is a distinguishable feature in modern human resource management (HRM). Given its considerable influence on the modus operandi of adopted HRM systems, scholars have delved into barriers to and facilitating conditions of line managers' fulfilling their HR duties and its subsequent outcomes over the past several decades. To deepen our understanding of the current state of the HR devolution literature, we adopt an evolutionary approach that moves beyond a conventional theme-centric review. Exploring the extant literature from a chronological stance offers a unique perspective since such an approach allows us to track and evaluate the development trajectory from its inception. Indeed, our evolutionary review reveals that critical observations on HR devolution practices documented by early studies (e.g., conflicts between line managers and HR professionals) have not been as articulated as they should be in recent endeavors (e.g., focus on line managers' competency and motivation). Through this review, we shed new light on the HR devolution literature and call for revisiting important yet unresolved issues that still resonate today. In addition, we contemplate the future of HR devolution practices amid a changing business landscape and suggest promising research avenues accordingly. By looking back at the road taken and paving the path forward, the current review will offer a guidepost benefiting both aspiring researchers and seasoned scholars in the field.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22067;Who pays the penalty? Implications of gender pay disparities within top management teams for firm performance. Despite the expected advantages of appointing women to corporate leadership roles, empirical evidence provides mixed support for the positive relationship between women's representation in the top management team (TMT) and subsequent firm performance. Considering the evidence that female TMT members are often paid less than their male colleagues, this study examines the implications of a gender pay disparity for the relationship between women's representation in the TMT and firm performance. Our analysis that draws on TMT pay data in public Australian firms demonstrates that gender pay disparities within TMTs negatively moderate the relationship between women's representation in the TMT and subsequent firm performance. Specifically, when female TMT members are paid less than their male colleagues, and this gender pay disparity is large, women's representation in the TMT is negatively associated with firm performance.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22060;Do leaders condone unethical pro-organizational employee behaviors? The complex interplay between leader organizational identification and moral disengagement. Considering recent corporate scandals, organizations have increased their efforts to curb unethical employee behavior. However, little is known about whether leaders comply with these efforts and how they respond to unethical employee behavior, especially when unethical actions benefit the organization. By integrating arguments from social identity and moral disengagement theories, we develop and test a model to explain how leaders respond to unethical pro-organizational behavior (UPB) among employees. Results from one multi-wave, multi-source field study and one experiment showed that leader perceptions of employee UPB were positively related to leader trust in employees when leaders identified strongly with their organization or when they had a strong propensity to morally disengage. Moreover, the results revealed an important three-way interaction effect. Leaders put considerable trust into UPB-enacting employees when leaders both identified strongly with the organization and showed high levels of moral disengagement. In contrast, they put little trust into UPB-enacting employees when leaders identified weakly with the organization and reported low moral disengagement. Furthermore, results showed that leader trust ultimately translated into perceived leader justice toward employees. These findings provide new and important insights into when organizations can(not) rely on their leaders to manage unethical employee behaviors.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22237;Investment in employee developmental climate and employees' continued online learning behaviors: A social influence perspective. In the contemporary digital age, continued online learning behaviors have become indispensable for fostering employee development. However, the learning and development literature predominantly focuses on traditional instructor-led approaches. It remains unclear how organizations can shape employees' learning behaviors, particularly in the context of online learning. The current study clarifies this underexplored research area by investigating how organizational investment in employee developmental climate (IEDC) can promote employees' continued online learning behaviors. Drawing on social influence theory and employing a multilevel research design, we find empirical support for our research model, which specifies that IEDC positively affects employees' continued online learning behaviors through the effect of normative pressure. The findings also reveal the moderating role of online learning facilitating conditions. Specifically, in firms characterized by higher levels of online learning facilitating conditions, the positive relationship between IEDC and normative pressure becomes more pronounced when compared to organizations with lower levels of such facilitating conditions.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22217;Conscientiousness and perceived ethicality: Examining why hierarchy of authority diminishes this positive relationship. Human resource (HR) managers hire conscientious employees because they are both productive and are viewed as upholding high ethical standards due to their propensity to engage in voice. Organizations may strive to create a work context conducive to all employees acting ethically, not just conscientious ones, by centralizing decision-making authority and promoting formalization through a higher hierarchy of authority. Yet, we propose that from the social information processing perspective, in higher hierarchy of authority contexts, peers may view their highly conscientious colleagues as less ethical. We hypothesize these effects through the lens of trait activation theory, according to which in a higher hierarchy of authority context, others are less likely to notice the voice behaviors of conscientious employees. Problematically, when others fail to notice conscientious employees' voice, they may perceive these workers as being less ethical. We tested our hypothesized moderated mediation model in a matched sample of employees (N = 820), their supervisors (N = 445), and peers (N = 529). As predicted, hierarchy of authority moderated the positive relationship between conscientiousness and voice, which in turn explained others' perceptions of their ethicality. Conscientiousness was positively related to peer assessments of ethicality via promotive (not prohibitive) voice when hierarchy of authority was lower (but not higher), partially supporting our hypotheses. These results suggest HR practitioners should be cognizant of the differential evaluations of highly conscientious employees in contexts with different levels of hierarchy of authority, and continuing challenges associated with balancing flexibility and formalization.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22199;Put your own oxygen mask on first: A behavioral typology of leaders' self-care. Organizational leaders are essential in implementing, interpreting, and even proactively initiating changes for human resource (HR) functions to enhance workplace productivity and well-being. However, recent studies have cautioned that providing positive and supportive leadership usually drains these organizational leaders. Although the literature has shed light on how leaders can use self-care strategies to recharge, researchers and HR professionals know relatively little about (1) what specific self-care actions leaders can take and (2) how external crises such as COVID-19 constrain leaders' self-care actions. To identify specific leaders' self-care behaviors, which we refer to as oxygen masks, we interviewed 41 healthcare managers in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. We presented a behavioral typology summarizing distinct oxygen masks that leaders used at different points in time. These oxygen masks include improving physical well-being, improving emotional/spiritual/social well-being, fulfilling managerial roles, and seeking collegial and organizational support. Moreover, we concluded that the COVID-19 restrictions made some of these oxygen masks less accessible, negatively impacting leaders' well-being. Our research conclusions have implications for theory and future studies on extending the literature associated with leadership development, leaders' resilience, and leaders' well-being. The results also provide HR professionals with practical suggestions about assisting line managers in improving their self-care and sustaining their leadership effectiveness.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22160;High performance work systems and employee mental health: The roles of psychological empowerment, work role overload, and organizational identification. Employee mental health is a central issue in today's global workplace. This paper analyzes the effect of high performance work systems (HPWSs) on employee mental health. We integrate HPWS concepts with job demands-resources (JD-R) theory to examine competing theoretical perspectives-a positive HPWS influence and a negative HPWS influence on employee mental health. We examine employees' perceptions of psychological empowerment as an indicator of the motivational pathway of the JD-R and work-role overload as an indicator of the strain pathway to explain the differential effect of HPWSs on mental health. We also incorporate organizational identification theory to demonstrate how one's identification with the organization can either accentuate or attenuate feelings of both psychological empowerment and work-role overload. Findings from a study of 999 employees in 174 South Korean organizations indicate that HPWSs are positively associated with employee mental health via employee perceptions of empowerment and that HPWSs are negatively associated with employee mental health through perceptions of work-role overload. Furthermore, the study finds that organizational identification attenuates the relationship between HPWS and both empowerment and overload. Practice-level post hoc analyses also reveal that the job design characteristics, pay level, and participative decision-making are linked to empowerment. In addition, participative decision-making is most strongly associated with work overload.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1002/hrm.22103;Learning to listen: Downstream effects of listening training on employees' relatedness, burnout, and turnover intentions. The present work focuses on listening training as an example of a relational human resource practice that can improve human resource outcomes: Relatedness to colleagues, burnout, and turnover intentions. In two quasi-field experiments, employees were assigned to either a group listening training or a control condition. Both immediately after training and after 3 weeks later, receiving listening training was shown to be linked to higher feelings of relatedness with colleagues, lower burnout, and lower turnover intentions. These findings suggest that listening training can be harnessed as a powerful human resource management tool to cultivate stronger relationships at work. The implications for Relational Coordination Theory, High-Quality Connections Theory, and Self-Determination Theory are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1108/PR-03-2023-0222;Examining employee experiences of hybrid work: an ecological approach. Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the various forms of organizational and team-level actions that were perceived to be helpful or not helpful by employees as they navigate the hybrid work arrangements and how these had an impact on their work behaviors and experiences. This research utilized Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory as framework. Design/methodology/approach - The exploratory study used a qualitative approach in gathering data via online survey from a total of 45 Filipino employees working in a hybrid work arrangement for at least three months. The analysis utilized both inductive and deductive methodologies in examining the data. Inductive thematic analysis was used in coding the data based on the participants' responses, while the deductive approach ensured that the themes are aligned with the research questions and reflect the different systems within Bronfenbrenner's EST (1986). Findings - Results surfaced helpful organizational (e.g. provision of work tools, financial assistance, supportive policies and engagement and wellness initiatives) and team level actions (i.e. use of technologybased communication tools, open virtual door policy, effective performance management system, employee care practices and team engagement activities). Actions that were perceived as not helpful include inadequate technological infrastructure, poor communication, insufficient training, punitive policies/practices and leadership issues at the organizational level as well as unresponsive colleagues and ineffective implementation of policies/processes at the level of teams. Employees reported being able to build on savings, becoming more productive and having greater work-life balance amid hybrid work. However, they continue to be challenged by blurred boundaries and inability to disconnect from work similar to when work was done remotely and now with sustaining momentum given the shifts on where they do their work. Practical implications - The findings of this study may guide programs and initiatives of human resource management practitioners and organizational leaders as they support employees in navigating through hybrid work. Originality/value - The research expands extant knowledge on practices and experiences in hybrid work (Gifford, 2022). It also contributes to studies on human resource management that are nuanced based on where work is performed (Ng and Stanton, 2023) or with emerging work arrangements.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-07-2022-0481;Family-supportive supervisor behaviours and family cohesion: the roles of job crafting and passion for work. PurposeDrawing on social support theory, this study empirically investigates the relationship between family-supportive supervisor behaviours (FSSBs) and the family cohesion of employees in the presence of job crafting as a mediator and passion for work as a moderator.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses a structural equation modelling technique on three-wave, time-lagged primary data (N = 305) collected from employees of service sector firms in Pakistan.FindingsThe results reveal that FSSBs enhance the family cohesion of employees through the underlying mechanism of job crafting. Using passion for work as a moderator, the conditional analysis shows that the link between FSSBs and job crafting becomes stronger in the presence of high passion for work.Originality/valueThis study extends the literature on the link between FSSBs and job crafting and provides insightful theoretical contributions. This study advances social support theory by providing support for and detailing practical implications of promoting FSSBs, thus enhancing the understanding of the positive impact of job crafting behaviours across non-work spheres.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2022-0047;Normative telecommuting: the effects of group composition and task interdependence on telecommuter and non-telecommuter performance. PurposeThis study examines whether group-level homogeneity in telecommuting status is associated with performance differences between teleworkers and non-teleworkers at the individual level. The authors further investigate the impact of group-level task interdependence on this relationship.Design/methodology/approachA group of 225 employees in 41 work groups were surveyed, and employee performance data from the organization was used. A multilevel perspective was used to examine the influence of normative telecommuting on individual performance.FindingsIt was found that while performance differences between telecommuters and non-telecommuters in mixed groups favor non-telecommuters, those differences become non-significant as the proportion of telecommuters increases. Results further show that when group task interdependence is low, there are no performance differences between telecommuters and non-telecommuters. When group task interdependence is high, telecommuters perform better as the proportion of telecommuters in the group increases.Research limitations/implicationsFuture studies should examine the group norms that are formed in predominantly telecommuting groups that support successful telecommuting outcomes.Practical implicationsTelecommuters perform better in groups with proportionally more telecommuters, even when task interdependence is high.Originality/valueThis study furthers our understanding around how telecommuting can be managed at the group level to maximize performance potential.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-09-2021-0620;Sleep-deprived and emotionally exhausted: depleted resources as inhibitors of creativity at work. Purpose - Within the theoretical frameworks of conservation of resources and job demands-resources (JD-R), the study aims to examine how sleep deficit could be negatively related to creativity at work by depleting critical resources of creativity.Design/methodology/approach - The survey data were collected from 368 individuals nested in 40 teams at a call center. The authors conducted multilevel analysis to test the proposed hypotheses to account for the hierarchical nature of the data while simultaneously estimating the effect of predictors at different levels on individual-level outcomes and maintaining the predictors' level of analysis.Findings - Through the data, the study presents how the depletion of resource, that is, emotional exhaustion, functions as a mediating mechanism that connects sleep deficit to creativity at work. Further, the study presents that higher job demands can worsen the negative effects of resource depletion on creativity at work because they further deplete resources needed for creative behaviors. Specifically, when sleep-deprived, those working in a high-task-interdependence climate are likely to experience emotional exhaustion more severely than do those in a low- task-interdependence climate. Also, the relationship between emotional exhaustion and creativity is more negative for managers than for non- managers because of managers' higher job demands.Practical implications - By presenting sleep deficit-linked inhibitors of creativity at work, the authors highlight the importance of securing sufficient sleep and affective resources when designing jobs and HR practices in organizations.Originality/value - This paper addresses the call for attention to examining the mechanisms through which sleep deficit affects employee creative behavior.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-12-2021-0869;Making sense of a mess: doing resilience in the vortex of a crisis. Purpose The purpose of the paper is to investigate how human resource professionals (HRPs), in a variety of organizations, responded to the crisis brought about by the event of COVID-19. In particular, it aims to show how organizations, across all sectors, in Western Australia responded with urgency and flexibility to the crisis and showed resilience in practice. Design/methodology/approach The study is based on 136 questionnaire responses, 32 interviews and 25 managerial narratives. The mixed qualitative methodology was designed to enable an investigation of the impact of COVID-19 and the response of HRPs. Findings HRPs have responded with agility and flexibility to the impact of COVID-19. They have done so through extensive trial and error, sometimes succeeding, sometimes failing. They have not simply activated a preconceived continuity plan. Research limitations/implications The research indicates that resilience is an ongoing accomplishment of organizations and the people in them. The objective was description rather than prescription, and the research does not offer solutions to future pandemic-like situations. Practical implications The research suggests that, given the impact of COVID-19 on organizations, HR practices, processes and policies will need to be thoroughly reconsidered for relevance in the post-COVID world. Possible future directions are highlighted. Originality/value The research considers the actions of HRPs as they responded to a global crisis as the crisis unfolded.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Purpose Building on the person-supervisor fit theory, this paper examines how and when leader-follower moqi congruence positively impacts task performance. Design/methodology/approach With data collected from 174 leader-follower dyads in 41 project teams in Shanghai, China, the authors use polynomial regression and response surface plots to test the hypotheses on the effects of leader-follower moqi congruence. Findings Leader-follower moqi congruence positively affects followers' task performance, mediated by coordination. Task coordination was of higher quality when the congruence is achieved at a high level of moqi than at a low level. The effect of leader-follower moqi congruence on task performance (mediated by coordination) was weaker when leader-member exchange was low than when it was high. Originality/value This study identifies why leader-follower moqi can improve coordination and task performance. It extends person-supervisor fit theory and is an enhancement for moqi research and practice.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1108/PR-03-2021-0215;Emotional exhaustion, emotional intelligence and task performance of employees in educational institutions during COVID 19 global pandemic: a moderated-mediation model. Purpose The objective of the present study is to investigate the relationship between emotional exhaustion and performance. During the present coronavirus disease (COVID-19) global pandemic, as the world has come to a standstill and more than 200 countries have been seriously affected, the level of emotional exhaustion experienced by people worldwide is beyond one's imagination. But how organizations were coping with emotional exhaustion and maintaining performance has remained an important question. To address this, the authors developed a conceptual model suggesting that organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) can act as a mediator, and leadership style and emotional intelligence (EI) can act as moderators in alleviating the dysfunctional consequences of emotional exhaustion. Design/methodology/approach Using a structured survey instrument, data were collected from 384 respondents from the faculty and administrative personnel in the Mangalore Diocese educational institutions. The authors used stratified sampling and tested the psychometric properties of the instrument using Lisrel software. To test the hypotheses involving two-way and three-way interactions, the authors used Hayes (2018) PROCESS as a statistical technique. Findings The results revealed that OCB mediated the relationship between emotional exhaustion and performance. To alleviate the dysfunctional consequences of emotional exhaustion, EI and transformational leadership interact to influence OCBs. The authors found that at lower and higher levels of EI, employees exhibited OCBs when leaders exhibited a greater level of transformational leadership. Furthermore, the transactional leadership style interacted with emotional exhaustion to reduce the adverse effects of later on performance. Research limitations/implications As with any research based on self-report measures, the present study has inherent limitations of social desirability and common method bias. However, the authors have sufficient care to minimize, if not eliminate, these limitations. The research highlights the importance of EI, a contingency leadership style in organizations, to reduce the adverse effects of emotional exhaustion caused by the global pandemic. Practical implications This study contributes to both organizations and literature on personnel psychology and organizational behavior. The study suggests that individuals need to invest resources in developing the skills of controlling and regulating their emotions and engaging in extra-role behaviors. In addition, leaders in organizations need to exercise transformational and transactional leadership styles to combat the present COVID-19 global pandemic situation. Originality/value This study provides new insights into the importance of EI, leadership style, and OCBs in restoring the loss of resources because of emotional exhaustion. The conceptual model developed and tested is the first of its kind in India, to our knowledge, and contributes to both theory and practice.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-03-2020-0164;Give full play to the talent: exploring when perceived overqualification leads to more altruistic helping behavior through extra effort. Purpose This paper aims to build a moderate mediation model to delineate when and how employee with perceived overqualification will exert extra effort and therefore engage in more altruistic helping behavior. Design/methodology/approach The research hypotheses were empirically tested using multitime and multisource survey data. Given the nested nature of data (i.e. 52 immediate supervisors rated 143 subordinates), multilevel structural equation modeling analyses within Mplus were conducted to test the proposed model. Findings The results support the proposed moderated mediation effect and indicate that perceived overqualification is positively related to extra effort on a condition that there is either strong desire for higher workplace status or more developmental job opportunities. The extra effort will subsequently lead to more altruistic helping behavior. Practical implications Based on the findings of this paper, human resource managers should consider the job applicant's desire for workplace status and the organizational context the employer can provide when hiring overqualified employees. Second, organizations should carefully conduct job design to improve overqualified employees' on-the-job developmental experiences. Third, training programs should be conducted to help satisfy needs and improve workplace status of overqualified employees, so that they can exert extra job effort and engage in pro-organizational behaviors. Originality/value Drawing on motivation-opportunity-ability theory, this paper extends the limited understanding of important boundary conditions under which perceived overqualification can be beneficial. The findings add to the knowledge on extant literature by identifying altruistic helping behavior as a new outcome of perceived overqualification.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2020-0470;Managing bullying in the workplace: a model of servant leadership, employee resilience and proactive personality. Purpose This paper develops and tests a model for managing workplace bullying by integrating employee perceived servant leadership, resilience and proactive personality. Specifically, this paper explores servant leadership as an inhibitive factor for workplace bullying, both directly and indirectly in the presence of employee resilience as a mediator. It further explores whether proactive personality moderates the indirect relationship. Design/methodology/approach This is an empirical study based on analysis of survey data collected from 408 employees working in services and manufacturing sector organisations in Pakistan. Structural equation modelling was used to test the research model. Findings Structural equation modelling results support the proposition that servant leadership helps in discouraging workplace bullying, both directly and indirectly, in the presence of employee resilience as a mediator. However, employee proactive personality moderates this process, such that the association between resilience and workplace bullying is stronger for individuals with high proactive personality. Research limitations/implications This study's findings illuminate the strong potential of servant leadership for managing workplace bullying. This potential is attributed to positive role modelling in the workplace, which may assist in building followers' resilience. This study provides evidence to support the importance of leadership in the process by which employees develop better psychological resources to combat bullying at work. Originality/value This is the first study that examines the direct relationship between servant leadership and bullying at work. In addition, this study introduced the mediating effect of resilience and the moderating effect of proactive personality on this relationship.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2020-0379;The effect of work-family conflict and hindrance stress on nurses' satisfaction: the role of ethical leadership. Purpose The main aim of this study is to explore the moderating role of ethical leadership on the indirect effect of work-family conflict on nurses' job satisfaction via hindrance stress. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire was answered by 224 nursing professionals working in public and private health institutions. Findings A mediation-moderation model was estimated, and the results thereof indicated that work-family conflict has an indirect negative effect on satisfaction through the mediation mechanism of hindrance stress. Results also show that ethical leadership enhances this mediated relationship. Research limitations/implications The cross-sectional data limited the generalization of results. Future research should develop longitudinal studies, which will allow for conclusions to be drawn with regard to inferences of causality. Practical implications It is recommended that health organizations should develop ethical training for their leaders. By doing so, they will address two issues: the conciliation between work and family as well as the reduction of job stress, which will subsequently improve job satisfaction. Originality/value The originality of this empirical study lies in the exploration of the moderating role of ethical leadership in the indirect effect of work-family conflict, which, in turn, impacts on job satisfaction via the hindrance stress experienced by nurses. The study is innovative in the sense that it seeks to gain a greater understanding of the moderation-mediation mechanisms of the variables under study.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-08-2020-0603;Getting nowhere, going elsewhere: the impact of perceived career compromises on turnover intentions. Purpose The purpose of this article is to investigate the unexplored relationship between employees' perceptions that they have made compromises in their careers (i.e. perceived career compromise) and their turnover intentions, as well as how it might be moderated by two personal factors (materialism and idealism) and two contextual factors (abusive supervision and decision autonomy). Design/methodology/approach Survey data were collected among employees who work in the education sector in Canada. Findings Employees' frustrations about unwanted career adjustments lead to an enhanced desire to leave their organization. This process is more likely among employees who are materialistic and suffer from verbally abusive leaders, but it is less likely among those who are idealistic and have more decision autonomy. Practical implications For human resource managers, these results provide novel insights into the individual and contextual circumstances in which frustrations about having to compromise career goals may escalate into the risk that valuable employees quit. Originality/value This study contributes to human resource management research by detailing the conditional effects of a hitherto overlooked determinant of employees' turnover intentions, namely, their beliefs about a discrepancy between their current career situation and their personal aspirations.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2024-0041;Does voluntarism work for the workplace inclusion of individuals with disabilities in a country with limited equality structures?. PurposeThe study explores measures designed explicitly to manage people with disabilities in a context where diversity interventions are incorporated voluntarily. Furthermore, it examines global organizations' approaches to marginalized groups, such as people with disabilities, in a context where there is an explicit lack of state regulation on diversity measures.Design/methodology/approachAn abductive approach was adopted for the exploratory nature, which sought to understand how global organizations in a developing country utilize diversity management mechanisms to manage people with disabilities.FindingsThe findings reveal that human resources departments of international organizations operating in a neoliberal environment demonstrate two distinct perspectives for individuals with disabilities: (i) inclusiveness due to legal pressures and (ii) social exclusion.Originality/valueWe explored global organizations' approaches to marginalized groups, such as people with disabilities, in the context of an explicit lack of state regulation on diversity measures and showed that the absence of coercive regulation leads to voluntary actions with adverse consequences. The paper expands theories that critique the inclusion of individuals with disabilities in untamed neoliberal contexts and explains how the responsibilization of institutional actors could enhance what is practical and possible for the workplace inclusion of individuals with disabilities. Without such institutional responsibilization, our findings reveal that disability inclusion is left to the limited prospects of the market rationales to the extent of bottom-line utility.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-11-2023-0929;Have HR strategic partners left the building? The (new) role of HR professionals from a social-symbolic perspective. PurposeThis manuscript explores the evolving roles of HR professionals amidst global megatrends and organizational transitions, focusing on the Italian context, which has experienced disruptive adoption of new forms of work such as remote and hybrid work. In this challenging scenario, our research aims to uncover if and how HR professionals are transforming their roles or maintaining the status quo in navigating organizational changes, dealing with the upcoming working scenario, and challenging conventional perceptions of HR practitioners.Design/methodology/approachThe study employs the social-symbolic work lens, that contributes to a deeper understanding of how HR professionals work to construct organizational life, the identities of employees, and the societal norms and assumptions that provide the context for organizational action. This perspective highlights HR professionals' personal efforts, consisting of the emotional labor entailed in steering organizational transformations and, eventually, maintenance in a context where remote work has become prevalent. Data was collected through 16 online focus groups involving 76 HR professionals from Italian organizations.FindingsOur research offers two interrelated contributions to HR literature. First, we provide pieces of evidence on how HR practitioners act as agents of change in two emerging roles: the Wannabe Hero and the Ordinary Hero. This challenges the prevailing rhetorical discourse about the so-called HR business partner. Secondly, we delve into the persistent obstacles that hinder HR professionals from making a substantial impact in addressing radical changes. These findings will provide useful insights into effectively engaging HR practitioners as agents of change in organizational transformation, shedding light on praxis, structures, and their emotional work.Originality/valueThe paper analyzes HR professionals' social-symbolic work, which offers an original contribution to the comprehension of the activities they carry on in practice and the emotions they have been experiencing. These influence both the way HR professionals play their role and the organizational and institutional environment.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2023-0878;Good, bad and ugly experiences of non-binary gender inclusion at the workplace to frame employee value proposition. PurposeThe present study aims to gauge the experience of gender non-binary (NB) employees in the context of employee value propositions (EVP) in Indian enterprises and make suggestions for organizations to align their gender-aligned interventions with the EVP framework.Design/methodology/approachQualitative methodology was used for collecting data through semi-structured interviews and subsequent analysis of the transcripts. The data was gathered from 10 NB participants working in Indian enterprises with the use of non-probabilistic purposive snowball sampling.FindingsThe analysis revealed eight themes representing the good, bad and ugly experiences of NB individuals within the context of EVP. These findings underscore the potential of enriching value propositions for employees to promote gender inclusion in corporate settings, contributing to long-term organizational success.Practical implicationsThe study offers both theoretical and practical implications for fostering inclusivity at the workplace. It suggests that policymakers and organizations should align EVP with diversity and inclusion initiatives, re-evaluate hiring processes and promotion policies to ensure equal opportunities for NB individuals, provide regular staff training to address biases and implement inclusive insurance policies and representation in employee resource groups (ERGs).Originality/valueThis study provides unique insights into the experiences of NB employees within the framework of EVPs in Indian organizations.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2023-0511;Defender, Disturber or Driver? The ideal-typical professional identities of HR practitioners. PurposeThis study aims to contribute knowledge about different professional identities represented among HR practitioners from Weber's ideal types framework.Design/methodology/approachThe paper is based on semi-structured interviews with 34 Swedish HR practitioners working in large public and private organisations.FindingsThe findings reveal that HR practitioners' identity is perceived as indistinct, unclear and shattered, which leaves lots of room for interpreting HR identity. Based on a thematic content analysis, three different ideal-type identities are presented, each representing the characteristic traits of an HR identity type. These are the Defender who always supports the managers, the Disturber who questions the managers in favour of the employees and the Driver who focuses on the economic expansion of the organisation.Research limitations/implicationsOne of the potential constraints of this study is the authors' reliance on interview data. This finding implies that future research can employ mixed methods or observational techniques to bridge the gap between narrated responsibilities and real-time actions. The data source, predominantly from larger organisations, presents another limitation. This raises a significant research implication: there is a need to study identity formation among HR practitioners in smaller organisations. The theoretical framework this study contributes can aid in comprehending HR practitioners' identities and their corresponding actions. Continued research might explore the significance of these ideal-type identities.Practical implicationsThe model presented provides a new way of understanding HR practitioners' complex and shattered professional identity and the various stakeholders that direct different expectations towards them. This knowledge can be used both in HR education and in HR work as a basis for discussing the social work environment of HR practitioners and negotiating their work and identity.Originality/valueThe study contributes knowledge of the professional identities of HR managers, an under-researched area, especially when it comes to empirical research about the HR practitioners' own experiences of their everyday work and view of the HR profession.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-11-2022-0832;Bots for mental health: the boundaries of human and technology agencies for enabling mental well-being within organizations. PurposeThe importance of mental wellbeing and the need for organizations to address it is increasing in the post-pandemic context. Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being adopted in HRM functions, its adoption and utility for enabling mental wellbeing is limited. Building on the Open System Theory (OST) and adopting the technology-in-practice lens, the authors examined the roles of human and technology agencies in enabling mental wellbeing.Design/methodology/approachThe study was conducted in two stages;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2022-0454;Workplace ostracism: a qualitative enquiry. PurposeThe study aims to understand the phenomenon of workplace ostracism from multiple perspectives (target, perpetrator and observer). The understanding of the phenomenon is used to thematically analyse the antecedents of workplace ostracism and identify appropriate strategies for each antecedent.Design/methodology/approachThe study findings are based on face-to-face semi-structured interviews with thirty-three senior and medium-level employees from various public and private sector organizations in India. The interview transcripts were systematically analyzed to identify antecedents of ostracism, which were inductively grouped together based on similarity.FindingsThe antecedents of workplace ostracism were grouped into four major heads: perceived non-alignment with organizational needs;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-11-2021-0792;The dual-level effects of authentic leadership on teacher wellbeing: the mediating role of psychological availability. PurposeDrawing on the conservation of resources (COR) theory, this study examined the mediating role of psychological availability in the relationships between principals' individual-level and group-level authentic leadership and individual teachers' wellbeing, that is, job satisfaction, life satisfaction and emotional exhaustion.Design/methodology/approachThe authors conducted a three-wave online questionnaire survey among 266 teachers from 52 schools in China. Multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) was used to analyze the hypothesized relationships among the study variables.FindingsThe principals' group-level and individual-level authentic leadership were both positively associated with individual teachers' psychological availability, which in turn was positively related to their job satisfaction and life satisfaction, and negatively related to their emotional exhaustion.Practical implicationsSchool administrations should elevate the levels of principals' authentic leadership by selecting and developing authentic principals to increase teacher wellbeing.Originality/valueDiffering from prior research that has focused on the effect of authentic leadership at either group-level or individual-level, this study simultaneously investigated the dual-level effects of principals' authentic leadership. Moreover, psychological availability was found to mediate the dual-level effects of principals' authentic leadership on teachers' job satisfaction, life satisfaction and emotional exhaustion.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-09-2021-0690;Health services in Australia and the impact of antiquated rostering practices on medical scientists: a case for HR analytics and evidenced-based human resource management. Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the rostering practices and work experiences of medical scientists at four health services in the Australian public healthcare sector. There are over 16,000 medical scientists (AIHW, 2019) in Australia responsible for carrying out pathology testing to help save the lives of thousands of patients every day. However, there are systemic shortages of medical scientists largely due to erratic rostering practices and workload issues. The purpose of this paper is to integrate evidence-based human resource management (EBHRM), the LAMP model and HR analytics to enhance line manager decision-making on rostering to support the wellbeing of medical scientists. Design/methodology/approach Using a qualitative methodological approach, the authors conducted 21 semi-structured interviews with managers/directors and nine focus groups with 53 medical scientists, making a total 74 participants from four large public hospitals in Australia. Findings Across four health services, manual systems of rostering and management decisions do not meet the requirements of the enterprise agreement (EA) and impact negatively on the wellbeing of medical scientists in pathology services. The authors found no evidence of the systematic approach of the organisations and line managers to implement the LAMP model to understand the root causes of rostering challenges and negative impact on employees. Moreover, there was no evidence of sophisticated use of HR analytics or EBHRM to support line managers' decision-making regarding mitigation of rostering related challenges such as absenteeism and employee turnover. Originality/value The authors contribute to HRM theory by integrating EBHRM, the LAMP model (Boudreau and Ramstad, 2007) and HR analytics to inform line management decision-making. The authors advance understandings of how EBHRM incorporating the LAMP model and HR analytics can provide a systematic and robust process for line managers to make informed decisions underpinned by data.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2021-0734;Does motivation matter? How leader behaviors influence employee vigor at work. Purpose This study supposes to provide new insights into the role of leader behaviors in motivating employees by examining how and when spiritual leadership and contingent reward leadership facilitate employee vigor at work. Design/methodology/approach Drawing from self-determination theory (SDT), the current study proposes that spiritual leadership intrinsically motivates employees, whereas contingent reward leadership extrinsically motivates employees - both of which subsequently improve employee vigor at work. The theoretical model was tested through a sample of 191 employees collected across three time points in China. Findings Results revealed that spiritual leadership positively facilitates employee vigor at work through enhancing their work enjoyment, and employees' need for achievement can amplify the effects of spiritual leadership. In addition, employees' performance-reward expectancy transmits the effects of contingent reward leadership on employee vigor at work, and leaders' performance expectations play a key role in strengthening the positive influences of contingent reward leadership. Originality/value Based on SDT, this study provides a comprehensive explanation of how and when two patterns of leader behaviors affect employee vigor at work. Therefore, the authors provide significant insights for leadership and work design in human resource management.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-07-2020-0510;The role of individual characteristics and working conditions in understanding boredom at work. Purpose This study proposes an examination of the psychometric properties of the French version of two boredom scales (i.e. the Dutch Boredom Scale and the Boredom Proneness Scale Short Version), the antecedents of boredom at work, based on an integrative theoretical framework drawing on the Job Demand-Resources model (Bakker and Demerouti, 2017) and the moderating effects of individual characteristics on the relation between contextual antecedents and boredom at work. Design/methodology/approach This study was based on a cross-sectional design with a sample of 363 Swiss workers. First, the two boredom scales were validated through a confirmatory factor analysis. Then, in order to study the relative strength of the predictors of boredom at work, a hierarchical regression model was tested. Finally, the interaction effects between individual characteristics and contextual antecedents of boredom at work were tested. Findings Factor analyses revealed a unidimensional structure for both instruments. Regression results showed that boredom proneness, job demands, job autonomy and social utility added a significant percentage of incremental variance to the model. Moreover, a significant interaction between contextual and individual characteristics in predicting boredom at work was observed. Practical implications Our findings stress the importance of taking into account employees' experiences at work when developing job design interventions to promote well-balanced working conditions for all, as well as targeted solutions for specific populations, in order to adequately address the issue of boredom in the workplace. Originality/value This study explores the relatively under-researched topic of boredom at work, known to be detrimental for individuals and organizations. To date, research on its antecedents has been quite fragmented and we particularly contribute to the literature by investigating this aspect.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-12-2017-0396;Improving performance through leaders' forgiveness: the mediating role of radical innovation. Purpose The objective of this study is to analyze the relationship between leaders' forgiveness and organizational performance using radical innovation as an explanatory variable. Design/methodology/approach The study was conducted in a sample frame of 11,594 Spanish companies. A total of 600 valid questionnaires were obtained. The structural equations were used to validate the proposed hypotheses. Findings Results confirmed the hypotheses proposed in the model: the authors provided, through structural equations, empirical evidence of the relationship between leaders' forgiveness and organizational performance, mediated by radical innovation. Leaders' forgiveness promotes radical innovation and, in turn, performance. Research limitations/implications The sample of companies is heterogeneous in terms of firm turnover, size and age. The study is focused on radical innovation. Practical implications The present study may help to develop more humane policies to manage human resources, by taking into account employees' feelings and needs. Originality/value The business field is closer to competitive values and has traditionally underestimated the importance of leaders' forgiveness. This is one of the few studies that empirically analyze the consequences of leaders' forgiveness within organizations.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22252;Predicting and Explaining Assessment Center Judgments: A Cross-Validated Behavioral Approach to Performance Judgments in Interpersonal Assessment Center Exercises. Although Assessment Center (AC) role-play assessments have received ample attention in past research, their reliance on actual behavioral information is still unclear. Uncovering the behavioral basis of AC role-play assessments is, however, a prerequisite for the optimization of existing and the development of novel automated AC procedures. This work provides a first data-driven benchmark for the behavioral prediction and explanation of AC performance judgments. We used machine learning models trained on behavioral cues (C = 36) to predict performance judgments in three interpersonal AC exercises from a real-life high-stakes AC (selection of medical students, N = 199). Three main findings emerged: First, behavioral prediction models showed substantial predictive performance and outperformed prediction models representing potential judgment biases. Comparisons with in-sample results revealed overfitting of traditional approaches, highlighting the importance of out-of-sample evaluations. Second, we demonstrate that linear combinations of behavioral cues can be strong predictors of assessors' judgments. Third, we identified consistent exercise-specific patterns of individual cues and cross-exercise consistent behavioral patterns of behavioral dimensions and interpersonal strategies that were especially predictive of the assessors' judgments. We discuss implications for future research and practice.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22172;Leveraging relational analytics in human resource research and practice. Relational analytics-the leveraging of data on workplace relationships-acts as a complement to traditional people analytics and moves scholars and practitioners closer to an understanding of the realities of the modern workplace. This article serves as a primer for relational analytics by highlighting the potential of the perspective for human resources, the levels of analysis that can be used to study relational analytics, and some of the common theoretical perspectives employed in this area. We introduce the 15 articles in the special issue by positioning them within broader trends we see in the field of relational analytics. Finally, we provide commentary on challenges and future directions in relational analytics with a focus on how the articles in this special issue may serve as examples of best practices and inspiration for future research and practice.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22161;Effective communication for relational coordination in remote work: How job characteristics and HR practices shape user-technology interactions. The theory of relational coordination holds that frequent, timely, accurate, and problem-solving communication positively interacts with relationships of mutual respect, shared goals, and shared knowledge to support effective work coordination. With increasing numbers of employees working remotely, Advanced Communication Technologies (ACTs) are crucial for enabling the communication necessary for relational coordination. To investigate how organizations can maintain effective communication between employees in remote work settings, we conducted 47 interviews across multiple organizations. We find that users enact different affordances, that is, action possibilities, of the same material features of an ACT. Enacting these affordances supports frequent, timely, accurate, and problem-solving communication when working remotely. Which affordances users enact varies systematically with job characteristics. Specifically, users whose jobs have high levels of task variety, autonomy, creative problem solving, and interdependence across teams enact more of the affordances that enable effective communication. Comprehensive ACTs that integrate all communication features into one technology and rules requesting the company-wide exclusive interaction with this ACT strengthen the relationship between users' job characteristics and affordance enactment. Our findings show that it is important to involve HRM from the outset so that, in close cooperation with IT, a system can be found that-supported by suitable sets of rules-enables effective communication.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22105;Employer image within and across industries: Moving beyond assessing points-of-relevance to identifying points-of-difference. This study draws from brand positioning research to introduce the notions of points-of-relevance and points-of-difference to employer image research. Similar to prior research, this means that we start by investigating the relevant image attributes (points-of-relevance) that potential applicants use for judging organizations' attractiveness as an employer. However, we go beyond past research by examining whether the same points-of-relevance are used within and across industries. Next, we further extend current research by identifying which of the relevant image attributes also serve as points-of-difference for distinguishing between organizations and industries. The sample consisted of 24 organizations from 6 industries (total N = 7171). As a first key result, across industries and organizations, individuals attached similar importance to the same instrumental (job content, working conditions, and compensation) and symbolic (innovativeness, gentleness, and competence) image attributes in judging organizational attractiveness. Second, organizations and industries varied significantly on both instrumental and symbolic image attributes, with job content and innovativeness emerging as the strongest points-of-difference. Third, most image attributes showed greater variation between industries than between organizations, pointing at the importance of studying employer image at the industry level. Implications for recruitment research, employer branding, and best employer competitions are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22086;The performance impact of gender diversity in the top management team and board of directors: A multiteam systems approach. Given the mixed evidence that having both women and men in the top management team (TMT) or in the board of directors (BOD) has a significant influence on organizational innovation, we resolve this issue by conceptualizing TMT-BOD gender diversity as part of a multiteam system, that has joint effects which impact organizational innovation. Evidence from the study of both Chinese firms and UK firms confirm our conceptualization by showing an interaction effect between TMT gender diversity and BOD gender diversity such that innovation is greatest when both are high. The positive TMT-BOD gender diversity interaction effect on innovation improves subsequent firm performance particularly in dynamic environments. The findings refine current thinking by going beyond research that tests intra-team TMT or BOD diversity independently and instead considers inter-team diversity across both leadership teams within the strategic leadership upper echelons. In sum, findings show that high levels of TMT and BOD gender diversity result in more organizational innovation, which ultimately improves firm performance. We offer implications for women's inclusion in leadership as well as for research on the upper echelons.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22064;Chief executive officer positive framing and employee ownership. Employee ownership is an important governance tool used to encourage employee participation and enhance employee productivity, but we know little about what encourages employee ownership. This study investigates the influence of chief executive officer (CEO) positive framing in public speeches on employee ownership. We propose that CEO positive framing can increase employee ownership when employees internalize CEOs' positive beliefs about firms' accomplishments and prospects. Using a sample of 664 U.S. listed firms from 2002 to 2018, we find that CEO positive framing increases employee ownership. In addition, the stock purchasing behaviors of top executives, analyst recommendations, and positive media coverage strengthen the effectiveness of CEOs' positive framing on employee ownership. Findings from this study advance employee ownership research by highlighting the vital role of CEOs' public language use in promoting employee ownership.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22062;Unintended consequences of promotions: Importance of annual incentives for performance management systems. With increased globalization, multinational enterprises (MNEs) have become pervasive in emerging economies such as India. Given that employee performance is multidimensional and culture-bound, the management of performance in MNEs is very critical for the successful implementation of their business strategy. We focus on promotions and incentives as they are considered the two crucial aspects of any performance management system. Based on a multisource, temporal study spanning over 19 months, we tested the interaction effect of promotion and annual incentive on employee outcomes. We conducted interviews of 15 senior officers in phase 2 to understand the inconsistencies in our findings. The contribution of the study to industry and academia are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22259;Career Guidance and Employment Issues for Neurodivergent Individuals: A Scoping Review and Stakeholder Consultation. Growing recognition of neurodivergence amongst individuals poses challenges for career counselors and human resource practitioners when advising, guiding, and supporting the careers of this diverse group. Despite the potential for neurodivergent individuals to contribute to organizations, career guidance for these individuals is a relatively new area. We conducted a multidisciplinary project comprising a scoping review and stakeholder consultation to generate evidence-based recommendations for identifying and supporting career paths that lead to positive employment outcomes for neurodivergent individuals. The scoping review included 78 articles on career guidance and associated employment issues (e.g., facilitators and barriers to employment) for neurodivergent individuals, while stakeholders, including neurodivergent individuals, counselors, and others, provided insights into their employment experiences. Our scoping review yielded nine themes: career guidance practice, predictors of employment, employment interventions, different forms of employment, work barriers and facilitators, strengths and challenges, person-job fit, occupation and industry fit, and employment outcomes. The stakeholder consultations complemented the scholarly themes. Results were interpreted using the Stone and Colella theoretical model of factors influencing the treatment of people with disabilities. The model was extended across educational and work contexts, and to include the nature of occupations and industries. Building on this project and our overarching theoretical model, we map a future research agenda for the study of careers amongst neurodivergent individuals. Specifically, we highlight persistent methodological limitations of the literature before turning to theoretical implications across career stages. We conclude with practical implications for career counselors and human resource practitioners. Ultimately, our review calls for researchers and practitioners to help promote sustainable, high-quality, and fulfilling careers for neurodivergent individuals.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1002/hrm.22143;Family CEO successor and firm performance: The moderating role of sustainable HRM practices and corporate philanthropy. We develop and test a multi-stakeholder perspective of intrafamily CEO succession by exploring how family CEO successors affect post-succession firm performance under conditions of sustainable human resource management (sustainable HRM) practices toward employees and top managers, as well as corporate philanthropic activities in the broader community. Using a sample of 414 CEO successions in family firms listed on China's stock exchanges during 2008-2016, we find an insurance-like effect of both sustainable HRM and corporate philanthropy in enhancing firm performance of family CEO successors. Our results also show that firms with family CEO successors will outperform those with nonfamily counterparts under conditions of high employee compensation, low top management team (TMT) compensation, and long TMT tenure. Our findings suggest that sustainable HRM and corporate philanthropy complement rather than substitute in strengthening family leadership during CEO succession.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22121;Incongruous employer brand signals and organizational attractiveness: Evidence from multinational companies in China. In an era of information explosion, employers' information is often disclosed to employees and potential applicants from multiple channels and angles, which are usually combinations of positive and negative signals. How do such uncoordinated brand signals affect the attractiveness of an organization? Building on micro-corporate social responsibility (CSR) literature and three studies, we found that when potential employees perceived imbalanced brand signals of CSR and corporate ability, the positive impact of CSR on organizational attractiveness was strengthened when the company was weaker in its corporate ability. When they perceived conflicting brand signals of corporate social irresponsibility (CSiR) and corporate ability, the negative impact of CSiR on organizational attractiveness was strengthened when the company was stronger in its corporate ability. Supplementary analyses also demonstrated a significant three-way interaction among CSR, CSiR, and corporate ability. When such conflicting brand signals were presented, CSR weakened CSiR's negative impact when corporate ability was stronger. However, when corporate ability was weaker, CSR strengthened the negative impact of CSiR on organizational attractiveness. Our study offers guidance for companies with mixed employer brand signals and suggests enhancing applicant attraction via synergy among a company's public relations, human resources, and marketing functions.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22058;Investigating employee and organizational performance in a cross-border acquisition-A case of withdrawal behavior. Over the last two decades, performance management systems (PMSs) have been the focus of increasing attention. However, scant research has examined the link between individual- and organizational-level performance in the context of cross-border mergers and acquisitions. Employee withdrawal adversely affects organizations, and has thus been associated with negative consequences for organizations and regarded as a counterproductive work behavior. Our article presents an empirical investigation of determinants and consequences of employee withdrawal, and its impact on willingness to share tacit knowledge, knowledge transfer, and cross-border acquisition performance in the context of Chinese acquisitions in the UK. Based on a cross-sectional survey of 103 employees of an UK subsidiary and Chinese acquiring firm, we found that trust in the acquiring firm significantly reduces acquired firm employee withdrawal behaviors. Moreover, our findings indicate that employee withdrawal behaviors negatively impact employee willingness to share tacit knowledge. The findings further confirm that such willingness positively influences knowledge transfer, which, in turn, has a positive effect on cross border acquisition performance. Our article contributes to the PMS literature by enhancing the understanding of the process through which human resource management systems affect outcomes at different levels of analysis in the context of the cross-border acquisitions.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22249;Workforce neurodiversity and workplace avoidance behavior: The role of inclusive leadership, relational energy, and self-control demands. We draw on job demands-resources theory to develop and test a model that explores the direct and indirect (through relational energy) impact of inclusive leadership on workplace avoidance behaviors for neurodivergent employees. We also examine the moderating role of personal self-control demands in the relationship between relational energy and workplace avoidance. We tested our model using partial least square - structural equation modeling analysis with data collected using a time-lagged data collection in a sample of 215 neurodiverse employees working in multinational companies across the Gulf Cooperation Council region (i.e., Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Oman). The findings demonstrate that inclusive leaders mitigate workplace avoidance behavior in neurodivergent employees. That is, inclusive leaders create an environment that contributes to the cultivation of employees' personal relational energy resources. Then, high levels of relational energy interact with employees' level of personal demands (i.e., impulse control, resisting distractions) to reduce workplace avoidance behaviors. Our work speaks to the integrated role of demands and resources in workplaces that can thwart avoidance behaviors for neurodivergent employees.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22239;Passion versus positivity: How work passion and dispositional affect predict job satisfaction and its facets. Work passion-a motive that contains affective and cognitive components-is highly desirable and has positive consequences for individuals and organizations. We propose work passion as the missing piece that can explain unique variance in job satisfaction above and beyond the established predictor of dispositional affect. Taking a motivational approach based on the Dualistic Model of Passion and self-determination theory, we tested how two types of work passion (harmonious and obsessive) and two types of dispositional affect (positive and negative) predicted overall job satisfaction and nine job satisfaction facets (satisfaction with pay, promotion, supervision, fringe benefits, contingent rewards, operating conditions, coworkers, the nature of work, and communication). In a two-wave study of working adults, structural equation modeling and regression-based relative weights analysis showed that harmonious passion predicted the largest proportion of variance in job satisfaction overall and in all nine of its facets. Together, our findings highlight the importance of harmonious passion and the utility of a motivational theoretical perspective on job satisfaction for HR scholars and practitioners.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22206;Expatriate managers' personal financial insecurity indirectly thwarts team innovation: The role of state learning goal orientation. This paper studies the downstream effect of expatriate managers' personal financial insecurity on team innovation. Building on resource allocation theory, we propose a moderated serial mediation model. Using four-wave, multi-source survey data from 99 R&D expatriate teams within large technology companies in emerging markets, we find that expatriate managers' personal financial insecurity is negatively related to team innovation first through a lower level of state learning goal orientation in the last month, and subsequently through a lower level of intellectual stimulation behavior. The negative effect of expatriate managers' personal financial insecurity on state learning goal orientation is weakened when professional identification is higher (vs. lower). Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22202;Reactions to asynchronous video interviews: The role of design decisions and applicant age and gender. Asynchronous video interviews (AVIs) are a form of one-way, technology-mediated selection interview that can help streamline and increase flexibility in the hiring process and are used to hire millions of applicants per year. Although applicant reactions to AVIs in general tend to be more negative than with traditional interview modalities, AVIs can differ widely in how they are designed. For instance, applicants can be provided with more or less preparation time, response length, rerecording options, or rely on different question formats. This study examines how AVI design features impact applicant reactions, as well as the moderating role played by applicant age and gender. Data from 27,809 real job applicant's AVI experiences were collected in 11 countries (69.3% English-speaking) from 33 companies and relating to 72 types of positions. Data were fitted with linear mixed-effects models to account for nesting. Results showed that allowing more preparation time and offering the opportunity to rerecord responses were related to more favorable reactions, while including more questions was related to more negative reactions. Applicants above the age of 31 reacted especially negatively to AVIs with more questions while those below the age of 30 preferred being allocated longer maximum response lengths. Women reacted more positively to increased preparation time. These findings might help both AVI vendors and hiring organizations design AVIs that facilitate a positive applicant experience. Our research also expands knowledge on applicant reactions to interviews, highlights crucial differences from traditional formats, and calls for integrating applicant characteristics into current theoretical frameworks on applicant reactions to AVIs.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22194;Enacting people analytics: Exploring the direct and complementary effects of analytical and storytelling skills. Although research identifies analytical and storytelling skills as the two broad human capital inputs required to perform people analytics, further research is required to better understand how People Analysts that is, the enactors of people analytics, perceive the impact of these skills on their performance. Accordingly, this study draws on the human capital resource (HCR) and HCR complementarity frameworks to investigate the individual and collective impact of analytical and storytelling skills on People Analysts perceived job performance. A mixed-method sequential explanatory research design is adopted, finding mixed results. Consistent with existing research, results from Phase 1 find People Analysts perceive storytelling skills to be positively associated with their job performance. However, contrary to existing claims, the findings reveal that analytical skills are only perceived to be significant in influencing People Analysts job performance when combined with storytelling skills, supporting a complementarity HCR relationship. To further explain the findings from Phase 1, Phase 2 involved collecting data from 50 people analytics professionals via semi-structured interviews. Results from the thematic analysis reinforce the survey findings while also illustrating that People Analysts perceive the complementarity relationship between analytical and storytelling skills as important for improving job performance. Accordingly, we argue that debate in this area should be reframed to acknowledge the necessity of complementarities in building people analytics capabilities.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22096;A human capital-based framework of career, well-being, and social information reasons for managerial lateral job assignment preferences. Research on job assignments has generally assumed employees will accept assignments when offered. In this study, we examine managerial preferences for potential job assignment opportunities conceptualized using human capital theory to provide a holistic understanding of this phenomenon. Using two pilot studies, we refine the list of reasons managers use when forming lateral assignment preferences. In the main study, we collected data from a representative sample of more than 1200 managers in a large US organization who provided preferences for all possible assignment locations (about 40) in their regions and reported reasons for their preferences. Results showed career development reasons (e.g., promotion potential, opportunity to learn) and social information reasons (e.g., location manager, customers) attracted managers to assignments, and health and well-being reasons (e.g., commuting, stress) repelled managers. There were several differences in these relationships by managerial level such that health and well-being reasons were more important than career development reasons for lower-level managers than higher-level managers, who seemed to generate their preferences based more evenly on both types of reasons. We ask whether gender moderates the relationship between health and well-being reasons and preferences and find little support. We also explore whether manager racioethnicity moderates the relationship between community racioethnicity and preferences and find a few differences. Most findings were replicated when predicting actual movement 2 years later. Results suggest managerial preferences should consistently be considered in job assignment research and that organizations should obtain and use preference data when making internal staffing decisions.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-09-2022-0658;The machine/human agentic impact on practices in learning and development: a study across MSME, NGO and MNC organizations. PurposeThe importance of learning in development in increasingly dynamic contexts can help individuals and organizations adapt to disruption. Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a disruptive technology, with increasing adoption by various human resource management (HRM) functions. However, learning and development (L&D) adoption of AI is lagging, and there is a need to understand of this low adoption based on the internal/external contexts and organization types. Building on open system theory and adopting a technology-in-practice lens, the authors examine the various L&D approaches and the roles of human and technology agencies, enabled by differing structures, different types of organizations and the use of AI in L&D.Design/methodology/approachThrough a qualitative interview design, data were collected from 27 key stakeholders and L&D professionals of MSMEs, NGOs and MNEs organizations. The authors used Gioia's qualitative research approach for the thematic analysis of the collected data.FindingsThe authors argue that human and technology agencies develop organizational protocols and structures consistent with their internal/external contexts, resource availability and technology adoptions. While the reasons for lagging AI adoption in L&D were determined, the future potential of AI to support L&D also emerges. The authors theorize about the socialization of human and technology-mediated interactions to develop three emerging structures for L&D in organizations of various sizes, industries, sectors and internal/external contexts.Research limitations/implicationsThe study hinges on open system theory (OST) and technology-in-practice to demonstrate the interdependence and inseparability of human activity, technological advancement and capability, and structured contexts. The authors examine the reasons for lagging AI adoption in L&D and how agentic focus shifts contingent on the organization's internal/external contexts.Originality/valueWhile AI-HRM scholarship has primarily relied on psychological theories to examine impact and outcomes, the authors adopt the OST and technology in practice lens to explain how organizational contexts, resources and technology adoption may influence L&D. This study investigates the use of AI-based technology and its enabling factors for L&D, which has been under-researched.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2019-0219;Sharing in the gig economy: from equitable work relations to exploitative HRM. Purpose - This paper aims to examine human resource management (HRM) in the gig economy through a moral economy lens and to uncover how sharing and firm ownership influences the (un)ethical use of HRM practices and worker treatment. Design/methodology/approach - Conceptual and empirical insights from contemporary HRM literature are synthesised through a systematic literature review to elucidate pressing challenges for research and practice. Findings - The analysis reveals that the different ownership structures used by gig firms shape the nature and degree of sharing. The gig economy built on investor ownership leads to greater sharing with investors and tends to be more exploitative of workers, whereas platforms built on collaborative ownership engage in greater peer-to-peer sharing which is more equitable and leads to higher quality work relations and HRM. Practical implications - The closer an organisation's alignment with the more equitable/relational end of the gig economy spectrum, the better the work relations and HRM. Originality/value - A new integrated conceptual spectrum of sharing in the gig economy is advanced, which aids in understanding evolving developments in HRM theory and practice.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-08-2021-0612;Fostering employees' resilience and psychological well-being through an app-based resilience intervention. Purpose The purpose of this study was to address calls for and test efficacy of an app based, short term resilience intervention for individual benefit. Design/methodology/approach Three independent samples of participants were assessed to determine the efficacy of an employee focused resilience intervention. Study 1 includes a cross sectional validation of the approach. Study 2 examines validity of the intervention using pre- and post-tests. Study 3 utilizes random assignment of groups (treatment and control) to determine invention results on resilience and individual psychological well-being. Findings Evidence suggests employees in the experimental group reported higher levels of resilience and psychological well-being as a result of the intervention. Further, the authors found no significant changes in resilience or psychological well-being amongst employees in the control group suggesting the intervention induced the effect. Originality/value Previous research attempting resilience interventions have been long, cumbersome and expensive for organizations. Basing the authors' method on previous research regarded as micro interventions, this intervention is individualized, flexible and very cost effective for organizational application.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2022-0086;Work from anywhere and employee psychological well-being: moderating role of HR leadership support. Purpose This study examines the relationship between the flexibility of working from anywhere and employees' psychological well-being (PWB) and safety. This study also investigates the moderating role of human resource (HR) leadership teams on HR policy (HRP), firm infrastructure (FRI) and remote work flexibility. Design/methodology/approach With the help of the literature review and flexible firm theory (FFT) and dynamic capability view (DCV) theory, a model has been developed conceptually. Later, the conceptual model is validated using partial least squares - structural equation modelling technique considering 471 useable respondents from different Asian and European firms to understand cross-country implications. This research study uses convenience and purposeful sampling techniques. Findings This study shows that there is a significant and positive moderating role of HR leadership support (HLS) towards developing flexible HRP and appropriate FRI to enable employees to work from anywhere. The results also indicate that there is a significant and positive impact of work from anywhere flexibility (WAF) and employee PWB and psychological safety (PSS), which in turn positively and significantly impact employee satisfaction (EMS) resulting in better firm performance (FP). Research limitations/implications This study provides valuable input to HR management teams for developing effective HR policies to enable a work from anywhere option. The study also provides food for thought to practitioners, researchers and academicians regarding the need for more research on the relationship between work flexibility, PWB and FP. Finally, this study develops a unique model which could be used by any firm towards framing an effective HRP enabling WAF. Originality/value This research adds value to the overall body of knowledge of HR management. There is no study which investigated the impact of WAF on employee PWB and PSS. Thus, this study is considered a unique study. Moreover, the proposed model in this research study is also a unique model with explanative power of 71%.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Purpose This study examined the dynamical and positive effects of leader consultation on employee proactivity from a motivational perspective. Design/methodology/approach Survey data were collected twice a day from 107 employees in a week by using an experience sampling method. Findings On a daily basis, leader consultation had a positive effect on employees' state work engagement, which in turn promoted employees' proactivity. Moreover, authoritarian leadership weakened the positive relationship between leader consultation and employees' state work engagement. Originality/value The findings provided a new perspective regarding the potential dynamic motivational effect of leader consultation on employees and generated interesting implications for paradoxical leadership theory.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-03-2021-0151;High-involvement work practices, employee trust and engagement: the mediating role of perceived organisational politics. Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine perceptions of organisational politics (POP) as a mediator of the relationship between high-involvement work practices (HIWPs) and employee outcomes (trust in employer and employee engagement). Design/methodology/approach Using a longitudinal time-lagged quantitative survey design, data were collected in two waves (n = 1,554, time 1, and n = 970, time 2). Direct and indirect (mediation) effects were tested through structural equation modelling (SEM) in AMOS. Findings The results of SEM suggest that HIWPs are positively associated with trust in the employer and employee engagement and negatively associated with POP. The data supported a partial mediation model in which POP mediated the relationship between HIWPs and both trust in the employer and employee engagement levels. Practical implications HIWPs reduce employees' perceptions of the degree to which their work environment is politicised, enhance employee engagement and develop a more trusting relationship between employee and employer. Originality/value Perceptions that workplace environments are characterised by political behaviours are ubiquitous and a large body of research has highlighted their detrimental effects on both employees and employers. This is the first study that has examined the potential of HIWPs in reducing such perceptions, which in turn, can foster employee engagement and enhance trust in the employer. Longitudinal studies of the effect HIWPs have on employee perceptions and attitudes are also still scarce.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2019-0295;Involved fathering: how new dads are redefining fatherhood. Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate how professional men in dual-career relationships craft and enact their fatherhood role ideologies during the transition to fatherhood. In particular, the authors focus on the impact that the development of a more involved approach to fatherhood has on the mother's ability to combine career and family. Design/methodology/approach This study utilizes a longitudinal, qualitative methodology. Pre- and post-natal interviews were conducted with 18 professional men in dual-career heterosexual relationships. Findings Although the traditional mode of fatherhood that is rooted in breadwinning continues to be the dominant approach among working fathers in the US, new modes of more involved fathering are emerging. The results of the study indicate that a general shift away from a strict, gendered division of household labor is taking place in today's dual career couples, and this is leading to an increase in men's involvement in childcare. Further, although much of the extant research conceptualizes fatherhood as a role typology, the results reveal that all fathers are involved in caring for their babies, though to varying degrees. Thus the authors propose a continuum of involvement. Finally, the authors discovered how men are finding creative ways to use official and unofficial workplace flexibility to be more involved at home. Originality/value The findings offer novel insights into the factors that encourage involved fathering. The authors encourage organizations to create more supportive environments that foster involved fathering by extending paid parental leave benefits to men and providing more access to flexibility.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2019-0334;An institutional view on the relationship between high-performance work system and organizational performance: the role of country of origin. PurposeThis paper extends the institution theory to examine the relationship between high-performance work system (HPWS) and organizational performance (OP), and analyzes how country of origin interacts with performance measures and industrial affiliation in moderating the HPWS-OP relationship.Design/methodology/approachThe paper collects data of 60,142 firms and establishments in 252 studies published up to December 2021 and employs meta-analysis techniques to test hypotheses on the role of country of origin in moderating the HPWS-OP relationship in conjunction with performance measures and industrial affiliation.FindingsThe paper finds that, firstly, there is a positive relationship between HPWS and OP, but the relationship is much stronger in developing than advanced countries. Secondly, the relationship is stronger when OP is measured in operational than financial term in both developing and advanced countries, but the moderating effect of performance measures is stronger in developing than advanced countries. Thirdly, the relationship is stronger in service than manufacturing industries in developing countries, but no such variation is found in advanced countries.Originality/valueThe study for the first time unveils the important role of country of origin in interacting with performance measures and industry affiliation to condition the HPWS-OP relationship, and provides a coherent explanation based on institutional theory. The study sheds fresh light on the HPWS-OP relationship, and has important implications for managers.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2021-0430;How human resource managers can prevent perceived pandemic threats from escalating into diminished change-oriented voluntarism. Purpose For human resource (HR) managers, the harmful outcomes of employees' ruminations about external crises, such as a pandemic, represent important, timely concerns. This research postulates that employees' perceptions of pandemic threats might diminish the extent to which they engage in change-oriented voluntarism at work. This negative connection may be attenuated by employees' access to two personal (work-related self-efficacy and organization-based self-esteem) and two relational (goal congruence and interpersonal harmony) resources. Design/methodology/approach The theoretical predictions are tested with survey data collected among employees who work in a banking organization in Portugal. Findings Persistent negative thoughts about a pandemic undermine discretionary efforts to alter and enhance the organizational status quo, but this detrimental effect is mitigated when employees (1) feel confident about their work-related abilities, (2) have a positive self-image about their organizational functioning, (3) share a common mindset with coworkers with respect to work goals and (4) maintain harmonious relationships with coworkers. Practical implications This study pinpoints several ways HR managers can reduce the danger that employees' worries about life-threatening crises may lead to complacent responses that, somewhat paradoxically, might undermine their ability to alleviate the suffered hardships. Originality/value The findings contribute to research on the impact of external crisis situations on organizations by providing an explanation of why employees may avoid productive, disruptive work activities, contingent on their access to complementary resources.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2020-0754;Is meaningful work always a resource toward wellbeing? The effect of autonomy, security and multiple dimensions of subjective meaningful work on wellbeing. Purpose Using conservation of resources as a theoretical lens, the paper aims to investigate distinct objective meaningful work (OMW) and subjective meaningful work (SMW) domains as resources that contribute to wellbeing. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional questionnaire was conducted with 879 employees, measuring OMW resources (job security and autonomy), SMW using the well-validated multidimensional Comprehensive Meaningful Work Scale (CMWS) focusing on five dimensions (integrity with self, expressing full potential, unity with others, service to others and balancing tensions), and three wellbeing outcomes (positive affect, negative affect and job stress). The authors conducted structural equation modeling, mediation analysis with PROCESS macro including bootstrapping, and dominance analysis, to identify the core relationships between OMW and SMW dimensions and three wellbeing constructs. Findings OMW resources are largely beneficially related to SMW dimensions;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2020-0429;How and when overqualification improves innovative work behaviour: the roles of creative self-confidence and psychological safety. Purpose This paper aims to examine the influence of perceived overqualification on innovative behaviour in the workplace. By integrating self-efficacy and human capital theories, this study proposes that perceived overqualification improves innovative behaviour directly and indirectly by boosting employee creative self-confidence. It further investigates the boundary conditions imposed by perceived psychological safety in this process. Design/methodology/approach The research utilises a quantitative research methodology through a two-wave survey of 335 employees and their 135 leaders. Moderated and mediated regression analyses were used to analyse the research data. Findings The results revealed that perceived overqualification promotes innovative behaviour at work directly and indirectly through its positive influence on creative self-confidence. The mediating effect of creative self-confidence in the relationship between perceived overqualification and innovative behaviour is moderated by perceived psychological safety at work, such that the relationship is stronger in a higher perceived psychological safety condition compared to when it is low. Research limitations/implications This study has theoretical and practical implications for personnel management. From a theoretical perspective, it integrates human capital and self-efficacy theories to explain a mechanism through which perceived overqualification will lead to innovative behaviour in the workplace. From a managerial perspective, it mitigates the stigma associated with an overqualified workforce by suggesting that perceived overqualification can be a source of innovation at work. Originality/value This is the first study that examines the creative self-confidence-based mechanism in the relationship between perceived overqualification and innovative behaviour at work. It also explores the moderating role of psychological safety in this relationship.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2021-0105;Designing innovative jobs: a fuzzy-set configurational analysis of job characteristics. Purpose How to design jobs to support innovation is an issue that has received plenty of consideration over the past years. Building on the job characteristics model, the present study is set up to identify configurations of perceived job characteristics for innovation. Design/methodology/approach By adopting a fuzzy-set configurational approach (fsQCA), the research question is addressed through a two-wave self-report survey of 199 employees of an Italian manufacturing company. Findings Results reveal four compatible configurations of job characteristics leading to high levels of innovative work behavior and two for low levels. Practical implications The results offer guidance for managers and organizations that aim to strengthen employee-driven innovation by offering different recipes of job design to maximize the chance of boosting innovative behaviors among their workers. Originality/value This research is one of the first to empirically test the relation of job characteristics for innovative behavior using a configurational approach. By doing so it contributes to the literature by advancing the notion that innovative endeavors are determined by the holistic effects of different interdependent configurations of job characteristics.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2019-0561;High-performance work systems and thriving at work: the role of cognitive appraisal and servant leadership. Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide a balanced and nuanced understanding of the relationship between high-performance work systems (HPWS) and employee thriving at work by aiming to consider the dark-side of HPWS and to uncover the black box. Design/methodology/approach This research draws from data from 377 employees nested in 77 work teams and tests a multilevel moderated mediation model using multilevel path analysis. Findings The findings indicate that employees appraise HPWS as both a challenge and a hindrance simultaneously. The challenge appraisal associated with HPWS positively influences employees' thriving at work whereas hindrance appraisal of HPWS negatively influences thriving experience. The results also support the hypothesized relationships in which servant leadership moderates the indirect effect of HPWS on employee thriving via challenge and hindrance appraisals accordingly. Originality/value This research demonstrates both positive and negative sides of HPWS as evaluated by employees in relation to an important employee outcome of thriving at work. It enriches the strategic HRM literature by identifying the black box of HPWS-employee outcomes and associated boundary condition from the theoretical perspective of cognitive appraisals.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-07-2020-0502;The role of human resource professionals (HRPs) in managing workplace bullying: perspectives from HRPs and employee representatives in Australia. Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the perspectives of human resource professionals (HRPs) and employee representatives (ERs) on the role of HRPs in managing workplace bullying. Design/methodology/approach Individual interviews were conducted with 12 HRPs and five ERs from a wide range of industries. Interview questions were open-ended and sought to gain insight on the views of the individual interviewees. Findings The findings address the role of HRPs in bullying scenarios and in the prevention of bullying. Regarding the role of HRPs in bullying, the responses of the participants suggest confusion and ambiguity, with a variety of roles being described ranging from a support-based role through to a protector of management. The participants also noted the importance of the HRP task of policy development, while a distrust of HRPs in bullying scenarios was mentioned. Regarding the effective management and prevention of bullying, the findings demonstrate that HRPs are viewed as having a central role through their particular responsibilities of creating and nurturing a positive organisational culture, as well as through engaging employees in the development of anti-bullying policies. Practical implications HRPs believe that they can contribute significantly to reducing workplace bullying through organisational culture (including educating staff and as role models of behaviour) and by engaging staff in the design of anti-bullying policies. Originality/value This paper contributes to the literature on workplace bullying by examining within the Australian context the perspectives of HRPs and ERs on how HRPs can prevent and manage workplace bullying.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Purpose The quality of service determines whether service firms can satisfy customers and achieve business quality and sustainability. As contemporary service firms are dependent on both team and employee to serve customers, it is important to investigate how to simultaneously facilitate team service performance (TSP) and employee service performance (ESP). Our aim is to build a multilevel model of the curvilinear effect of task conflict (TC) on TSP and ESP, as well as the moderating effects underlying the above curvilinear relationships.Design/methodology/approach Two-sourced data were obtained from 47 team leaders and 326 employees in Chinese hotels. Multilevel structural equation modeling was utilized for validating the model.Findings The results revealed that TC exerted a curvilinear effect on both TSP and ESP. Ethical climate (EC) and internal knowledge transfer (IKT) served as moderators strengthening the curvilinear nexus between TC and ESP.Originality/value We contribute to the conflict-performance stream in management literature by unmasking the curvilinear effects of TC on both TSP and ESP, and the moderation mechanisms underlying such curvilinear effects.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1108/PR-04-2023-0309;The role of employee personality in employee satisfaction and turnover: insights from online employee reviews. PurposeOnline employee reviews have emerged as a crucial information source for business managers to evaluate employee behavior and firm performance. The purpose of this paper is to test the relationship between employee personality traits, derived from online employee reviews and job satisfaction and turnover behavior at the individual level.Design/methodology/approachThe authors apply text-mining techniques to extract personality traits from online employee reviews on Indeed.com based on the Big Five theory. They also apply a machine learning classification algorithm to demonstrate that incorporating personality traits can significantly enhance employee turnover prediction accuracy.FindingsPersonality traits such as agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness are positively associated with job satisfaction, while extraversion and neuroticism are negatively related to job satisfaction. Moreover, the impact of personality traits on overall job satisfaction is stronger for former employees than for current employees. Personality traits are significantly linked to employee turnover behavior, with a one-unit increase in the neuroticism score raising the probability of an employee becoming a former employee by 0.6%.Practical implicationsThese findings have implications for firm managers looking to gain insights into employee online review behavior and improve firm performance. Online employee review websites are recommended to include the identified personality traits.Originality/valueThis study identifies employee personality traits from automated analysis of employee-generated data and verifies their relationship with employee satisfaction and employee turnover, providing new insights into the development of human resources in the era of big data.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1108/PR-07-2022-0485;How and when do strengths work? The effect of strengths-based leadership on follower career satisfaction. PurposeDrawing on conversation of resources theory, the present paper aimed to investigate the effect of strengths-based leadership on follower career satisfaction and the mediating role of follower strengths use as well as the moderating role of emotional exhaustion in the relationship.Design/methodology/approachResearch data were gathered at 3 time points with a sample of 210 participants working in various organizations in China. Structural equation model (SEM) was applied to examine the authors' hypotheses.FindingsThe results indicated that strengths-based leadership has a positive impact on follower career satisfaction and follower strengths use fully mediates the effect of strengths-based leadership on follower career satisfaction. More importantly, emotional exhaustion enhanced the direct relationship between strengths use and career satisfaction and the indirect association of strengths-based leadership with follower career satisfaction through follower strengths use.Research limitations/implicationsThe main limitation of the present paper was the single source of research data.Originality/valueThe present paper advances strengths-based leadership theory and research and provides a new insight into cultivating employee career satisfaction.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-12-2022-0869;How to lead responsibly toward enhanced knowledge sharing behavior and performance: implications for human resource management. PurposeThis paper investigates the relationships between responsible leadership and employees' knowledge sharing behavior and performance in the healthcare sector. The present study provides deeper insights into those relationships by uncovering the mechanisms through which relational and ethical dimensions of responsible leadership influence knowledge sharing outcomes. Drawing on the social exchange theory, this study examines the mediating role of trust in the leader and leadership support.Design/methodology/approachData were collected from 445 healthcare professionals in Pakistan. Structural equation modeling was employed to analyze the data.FindingsThe study findings revealed that responsible leaders enhance knowledge worker performance and knowledge sharing behavior through enhancing trusting relationships with followers and providing support. Furthermore, the authors investigated the moderating role of goal orientation, and the results showed that the effect of responsible leadership on knowledge worker performance was stronger for highly goal-oriented employees.Practical implicationsThis research suggests that human resource managers interested in fostering knowledge sharing behaviors, must focus on cultivating responsible leadership behavior within their organizations. Furthermore, this study findings propose that HRM practices should foster employee goal orientation in order to enhance knowledge workers' performance.Originality/valueThis study makes a novel contribution to the literature by shifting the research focus from the traditional view of leadership to a leadership style more responsive to the reciprocity nature of the relationships between employees and leaders. By shifting the focus to a relational-ethical based leadership style, the current study was able to fully uncover the underlying mechanisms linking responsible leadership to knowledge sharing outcomes.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

PurposeThe aims of this critical review are to identify the mentor characteristics that lead to superior mentoring outcomes and to provide human resources development (HRD) professionals with evidence-based suggestions for recruiting, selecting and training mentors to improve mentorship programme effectiveness.Design/methodology/approachThe authors conducted a critical review of existing quantitative research on mentor characteristics that have an impact on effective mentoring.FindingsThe authors identified five key categories of mentor characteristics linked to successful mentoring outcomes: competency in context-relevant knowledge, skills and abilities;art;" pro-social orientation and an orientation toward development, exploration and expansion.Research limitations/implicationsThere is limited research on the characteristics of ineffective mentor characteristics, exclusion of articles that used qualitative research methods exclusively and how technology-based communication in mentoring may require different characteristics. Most of the included studies collected data in the United States of America, which may exclude other important mentor characteristics from other non-Western perspectives.Practical implicationsTo ensure that there is both a sufficient pool of qualified mentors and mentors who meet the desired criteria, focus on both recruitment and training mentors is important. Incorporating the desired mentor characteristics into both of these processes, rather than just selection, will help with self-selection and development of these characteristics.Originality/valueDespite the ongoing interest in identifying effective mentor characteristics, the existing literature is fragmented, making this challenging for HRD professionals to determine which characteristics are crucial for mentoring relationships and programme success. Addressing this practical need, this critical review synthesises the research literature and identifies patterns and inconsistencies. Based on the review, the authors provide evidence-based recommendations to enhance the recruitment, selection and training of mentors."",art";;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Purpose Given the limiting gender role conditions arising from the prevalence of patriarchy in Nigeria and the shift to workers staying at home due to the deadly spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), this article aims to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the work-life balance of professional mothers using the work-home resources model as a conceptual lens. Design/methodology/approach The qualitative data is based on telephone interviews with 28 married female university academics with children. Findings The findings reveal that the confinement policies enforced due to the need to combat the spread of COVID-19 and patriarchal norms deeply embedded in the Nigerian culture have exacerbated stress amongst women, who have needed to perform significantly more housework and childcare demands alongside working remotely than they did prior to the pandemic. The thematic analysis showed a loss of personal resources (e.g. time, energy, and income) resulting in career stagnation, health concerns, and increased male chauvinism due to the abrupt and drastic changes shaping the new normal lifestyle. Research limitations/implications The study relies on a limited qualitative sample size, which makes the generalisation of findings difficult. However, the study contributes to the emerging global discourse on the profound negative consequences of COVID-19 on the lives and livelihoods of millions, with a focus on the stress and work-family challenges confronting women in a society that is not particularly egalitarian - unlike Western cultures. Originality/value The article provides valuable insights on how the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically affected professional working mothers in the sub-Saharan African context, where literature is scarce.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2021-0121;Informal learning and career identity formation: the mediating role of work engagement. Purpose The aim of the study is to extend prior research on career identity formation by investigating whether individuals' participation in informal workplace learning activities positively relates to career identity. The study also examines whether work engagement significantly mediates the participation in informal learning and career identity relationship. Design/methodology/approach Using data from a survey of 313 individuals in Iran, the study developed and tested measurement and structural models and employed partial least squares structural equation modelling to test the hypotheses. Findings The findings suggest that work engagement substantially mediates the positive relationship between participation in informal learning and career identity. Furthermore, the learning potential of the workplace and the propensities of individuals to actively approach situations that provide them with opportunities to learn and seek feedback on their performance have positive although varying relations with levels of participation in informal learning. Practical implications Human resource management and career management specialists must be cognisant of the central role that employee participation in informal learning plays in strengthening their work engagement and career identity. Learning and development specialists should seek to create conditions in the work environment that are favourable to informal learning and work engagement. Originality/value Although the role of formal development programmes in career identity formation is well documented, studies that examine links between participation in informal learning activities and career identity are very rare. Furthermore, there are no known studies that examine the potential mediating role of work engagement in the relationship between participation in informal learning activities and career identity.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-07-2020-0523;Organizational goal ambiguity and public service motivation: evidence from Iran. Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of organizational goal ambiguity (OGA) on public service motivation (PSM) considering the mediating role of job satisfaction (JS), performance appraisal (PA) and perceived organizational fairness (POF) in the Iranian public sector. This research also seeks to answer this question: to what extent PSM confirmed in Western countries is generalizable to the Iranian public sector? Design/methodology/approach A survey of 779 employees working in 16 ministries of Iran was administered. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and hierarchical regression were applied to test the model and the mediators. Findings The results indicate that OGA negatively affects PSM, and this relationship is mediated by JS, PA and POF. Furthermore, the research findings have varied across ministries, contract type, positions and gender. Most importantly, the generalizability of the PSM construct is limited in the public sector of Iran since two of four dimensions of PSM were confirmed, that is, an attraction to public service and self-sacrifice (compassion). Practical implications This paper provides managers and decision makers with a clear understanding of the effects of context (including goal ambiguity, the importance of employee's attitudes and HR systems in shaping unique intrinsic motivation for public organizations) on employee's PSM. Also, these findings show how they can manage and motivate employees to engage in PSM. By clarifying organizational goals or making an association between job tasks and higher-level goals, practitioners can stimulate PSM at work. Originality/value This paper advances a new and further understanding of antecedent and mediators of PSM in Iran. Also, it provides an explanation of its generalizability and the role of organizational climate in fostering it.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2020-0412;Should I stay or should I go? Skilled immigrants' perceived brain-waste and social embeddedness. Purpose Drawing on embeddedness theory, we examine how skilled immigrants' perceived brain-waste affects their social embeddedness. Social embeddedness facilitates the acquisition of host country-specific human capital, which, in return, can accelerate the transfer of immigrants' human capital in the workplace. Design/methodology/approach In total, 397 skilled immigrants in Australia participated in this study. We applied a set-theoretic approach to decode the complexity and interplay among the key concepts used in this study. Findings We found the impacts of psychological workplace wellbeing and workplace discrimination on social embeddedness differ between skilled immigrants who experience perceived brain-waste and skilled immigrants whose skills were recognized by employers. The results suggest that job satisfaction is the most critical factor contributing to social embeddedness among skilled immigrants who did not report brain-waste. Furthermore, we found that married skilled male immigrants who reported brain-waste still could embed socially if they did not directly experience workplace discrimination. Originality/value The majority of previous studies have compared skilled immigrants with their local-born colleagues, but we compared two groups of skilled migrants in the current study. We adopted fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to test how unique configurations of several variables can ease their social embeddedness into the host society.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2020-0313;Linking performance pressure to employee work engagement: the moderating role of emotional stability. Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the mediating role of threat and challenge appraisals in the relationship between performance pressure and employees' work engagement, as well as the buffering role of emotional stability, as a personal characteristic, in this process. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected using a three-wave research design. Hypotheses were examined with a sample of 247 white-collar employees from French organizations. Findings Performance pressure is appraised as either threat or challenge. Challenge appraisal positively mediated the performance pressure and work engagement relationship, whereas threat appraisal negatively mediated the performance pressure and work engagement relationship. Emotional stability moderated these effects, suggesting performance pressure was appraised as a challenge rather than a threat, which then enhanced employee work engagement. Practical implications This study has shown that employees with high emotional stability who perceived performance pressure as a challenge achieved stronger employee work engagement. Originality/value Building on Lazare's theory of stress and Mitchell et al. 's theorization, this research demonstrates mediating and moderating mechanisms driving the role of performance pressure on employee work engagement relationships.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-07-2019-0391;Does it pay to be bad? An investigation of dark triad traits and job performance in India. Purpose The current paper proposes a curvilinear relationship between the dark triad traits (Machiavellianism, psychopathy and narcissism) and job performance. In addition, it examines the moderation effect of traitedness on the dark triad-job performance relationship. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on data from 382 participants in a financial services firm in India, the authors conducted a two-phase study to examine the curvilinear and moderation effects. Findings Results confirmed that the relationship between dark triad traits and job performance is positive at the lower end of dark triad traits but flattens out as the dark triad traits intensify. Originality/value The authors discuss theoretical and practical implications and offer suggestions for future research.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-03-2020-0132;A review of work-life programs and organizational outcomes. Purpose Work-life programs research has been conducted at the individual and organizational levels, yet one important question remains unanswered: Do work-life programs improve organizational outcomes? Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a systematic literature review of the impact of work-life programs (bundles versus separate programs) on outcomes at the organizational level. A systematic selection process was adopted, resulting in a final sample of 35 articles published in 26 peer-reviewed journals from 1990 to 2019. Findings The findings suggest that these programs can result in positive, negative or no impact on organizational outcomes, depending on the study design, industry, organization size and country/region. Originality/value This review draws on quantitative and qualitative empirical studies to summarize, explain and refine the business case for work-life programs. The resulting framework provides directions for future research.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Purpose This study contributes to the literature by explicating why individuals become effective in performing tasks in intercultural context. Drawing from the social axioms theory and intelligence theory, this study specifically investigates and generates new insights about the role of social complexity belief and cultural intelligence (CQ) in enhancing intercultural task performance. Design/methodology/approach Two sets of studies were conducted. Study 1 was conducted in Australia (n = 222) wherein survey data were collected from employees (i.e. self-reports).

10.1002/hrm.22261;A Strengths-Based Human Resource Management Approach to Neurodiversity: A Multi-Actor Qualitative Study. Although the attention for neurodiversity in human resource management (HRM) is growing, neurodivergent individuals are still primarily supported from a deficit-oriented paradigm, which points towards individuals' deviation from neurotypical norms. Following the HRM process model, our study explored to what extent a strengths-based HRM approach to the identification, use, and development of strengths of neurodivergent groups is intended, implemented, and perceived in organizations. Thirty participants were interviewed, including HRM professionals (n = 15), supervisors of neurodivergent employees (n = 4), and neurodivergent employees (n = 11). Our findings show that there is significant potential in embracing the strengths-based approach to promote neurodiversity-inclusion, for instance with the use of job crafting practices or (awareness) training to promote strengths use. Still, the acknowledgement of neurodivergent individuals' strengths in the workplace depends on the integration of the strengths-based approach into a supportive framework of HR practices related to strengths identification, use, and development. Here, particular attention should be dedicated to strengths development for neurodivergent employees (e.g., optimally balancing strengths use). By adopting the strengths-based HRM approach to neurodiversity as a means of challenging the ableist norms of organizations, we add to the HRM literature by contributing to the discussion on how both research and organizations can optimally support an increasingly diverse workforce by focusing on individual strengths.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22205;Context is key: A 34-country analysis investigating how similar HRM systems emerge from similar contexts. Using an institutional lens, we investigate the isomorphic effects of both external and internal contexts on human resource management (HRM) systems. Our analysis uses data from 4768 organizations across 34 countries to focus on the similarities in HRM systems. By employing distance matrices, a commonly adopted method in geographic science, we find that both external and internal contexts affect (dis)similarities in HRM systems. Organizations in similar environments exhibit more similar HRM systems. Furthermore, we find that the devolvement of HRM activities from HRM to line management reduces the similarity of HRM systems across organizations. By contrast, a strong strategic position of HRM does not yield a comparable effect. Our study's main contributions include elucidating the multifaceted relationship between context and HRM, highlighting the HRM department's role in this relationship, clarifying the context-HRM connection via the concept of isomorphic pressures, and illustrating the use of distance matrices as tool with great explanatory power for the analysis of similarities among HRM phenomena.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22186;Profiles of diversity and inclusion motivation: Toward an employee-centered understanding of why employees put effort into inclusion and exclusion. Despite their prevalence, workplace diversity and inclusion (D & I) practices continue to produce inconsistent effects on employee attitudes and behaviors. This shines a light on the need for evidence-based approaches in understanding how employees enact D & I goals. Drawing on self-determination theory, we argue that employee D & I motivation is an untapped pathway for understanding how inclusion-supportive employee outcomes (i.e., more inclusion and less exclusion) emerge. In addition, we leverage attribution theory to inform when employee motivation can be shaped, demonstrating that employee attributions of the intentions behind their organization's D & I practices play an important role in shaping their subsequent D & I motivation. Across two studies, latent profile analysis identified five distinct profiles of D & I motivation, which were differentially related to inclusion and exclusion (Study 1) and predicted by D & I attributions (Studies 1 and 2). Combined, these findings highlight the importance of understanding employee motivations and attributions within the context of D & I. Such knowledge can inform how employees enact inclusion goals, which has the potential to help organizations realize the desired benefits of diversity.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22137;A relational view of shiftwork: Co-scheduling with higher performers. Research in HR has devoted little attention to the practice of scheduling shift workers into times and places to conduct their work. Relying upon the growing literature related to relational HR, we propose a relational view of scheduling that focuses on how employees' social contexts-particularly their being co-scheduled with higher performers-relate to changes in performance over time. We apply resource dependence and social learning theories to describe how employees' performance over time depends upon their working alongside higher performers. Higher performers consume limited resources (thereby constraining peers' performance in the short term), yet also provide instructive role models for learning new skills (thereby elevating peers' performance over the longer term). We further hypothesize these effects are stronger for employees who are newer to the firm in contrast to those with more experience. We analyze scheduling and performance data from 7,893 retail sales representatives over a 1-year period. Results show co-scheduling with higher performers has an immediate negative effect on employee performance, but is positively related to employee performance over time. Unexpectedly, co-scheduling effects were present for all employees and not only for those new to the organization. Our study points to the need for HR research on employee scheduling to better understand how shift workers' schedules provide the relational context for their work. The research offers several theoretical contributions in understanding the peer effects of higher performers, and we offer practical implications for managers seeking to design employees' schedules to encourage organizationally advantageous relationships between coworkers.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22134;Does emotional restraint or exuberance get you the job? How and when enthusiasm intensity is related to perceived job suitability. Scholars have identified that interviewers prefer applicants who are both emotionally restrained and exuberant. To reconcile these inconsistent results, we investigated how the magnitude of applicants' expressed enthusiasm influences interviewer perceptions of job suitability. In two experimental studies with recruiters in China, we show that expressing intense as opposed to mild enthusiasm reduces applicants' chances to be perceived as suitable for the job (Study 1). We further demonstrate that expressions of intense enthusiasm do not always undermine their perceived job suitability but can also lead to a positive interview outcome. We find that the negative consequences of intense enthusiasm are explained by interviewer perceptions of decreased appropriateness, whereas the positive consequences are driven by interviewer perceptions of the applicant's attraction to the organization (PAAO;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22116;Creative performance pressure as a double-edged sword for creativity: The role of appraisals and resources. Creativity, or the generation of novel and useful ideas or products, is widely viewed as the cornerstone of organizational innovation and success. However, high pressure to be creative may have mixed implications for employee creativity. In this article, we first systematically conceptualize the nature of the concept of creative performance pressure. Next, building on transactional stress theory, we investigate (a) how creative performance pressure influences employee creativity through different appraisals (i.e., challenge and hindrance) and (b) the moderating role of a job and personal resource (i.e., servant leadership and promotion focus) in the stressor appraisal process. In Study 1, we developed a creative performance pressure scale and assessed its psychometric properties across two samples (N = 181 for Sample 1;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22101;The role of perceived workplace safety practices and mindfulness in maintaining calm in employees during times of crisis. While prior studies in human resource management have investigated how employee outcomes have been affected in high-risk workplaces, this study stands out by examining this issue through the role played by COVID-19 as a specific stressor. We explained how employees' perceived health risks due to COVID-19 (CV19PHR) and perceived workplace safety practices (PWSPs) affected job performance via burnout and how PWSPs moderated the CV19PHR-burnout and CV19PHR-JP relationships. We also examined how mindfulness moderated the direct effects of CV19PHR and PWSPs on burnout and JP and the indirect effects of CV19PHR and PWSPs on JP via burnout. We performed three studies using an explanatory sequential mixed-method design. In study 1, a three-phase survey with 987 respondents was conducted to test the hypotheses. In study 2, by analyzing verbatim from 22 informants, the findings of study 1 and some main points concerning mindfulness and PWSPs were explained. In study 3, using data from 12 informants, we investigated how COVID-19 affected individuals differently compared with other high-risk workplaces and whether the impact of COVID-19 on individuals was curvilinear. We demonstrated that employees' CV19PHR was positively correlated with burnout, negatively influencing JP. Moreover, PWSPs reduced burnout, which adversely affected JP. Interestingly, PWSPs positively moderated the CV19PHR-burnout relationship but not the CV19PHR-JP relationship. We also found that mindfulness moderated the CV19PHR-burnout and PWSPs-burnout relationships. Furthermore, mindfulness significantly moderated the mediating effects of burnout on the CV19PHR-JP and PWSPs-JP relationships.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22057;Holistic indigenous and atomistic modernity: Analyzing performance management in two Indian emerging market multinational corporations. Analyzing qualitative case-study data from two emerging market multinational corporations (MNCs) from the Indian pharmaceutical industry, we develop two theoretical frameworks based on goal-setting and cognitive evaluation theories along with indigenous Indian management theories, including the principles of Ayurveda for analyzing performance management systems in an indigenous and modern pharmaceutical MNC. Data were analyzed from multiple data sources, such as interviews, non-participant observation, multiple site visits, organizational documents, policies, client testimonials, and publically available information through the website and annual reports. The indigenous firm offered a holistic approach to managing multiple stakeholders. Its overarching performance goal focused on all stakeholders collectively contributing to the patient' and others' holistic well-being. All employees' and stakeholders' unified and singular efforts dovetailed to achieve physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, and environmental well-being as a proxy for performance. Organizational values, culture, and contextual influences of informal learning, empowerment, and task variability helped achieve its overarching goals. The Western pharmaceutical firm focused on atomistic, granulated, and an objective way of assessing and evaluating performance, wherein cost-effectiveness, innovation, and high-performance were vital performance outcomes. Performance coaching and task invariability adversely affected individual outcomes. Implications for research and practice are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2024-0099;Algorithmic human resource management: toward a functional affordance perspective. Purpose - Organizations are increasingly deploying algorithmic human resource management (HRM) for decision-making. Despite algorithms beginning to permeate HRM practices, our understanding of how to interpret and leverage the functions of algorithmic HRM remains limited. This study aims to review the stock of knowledge in this field of algorithmic HRM and introduce a theoretical perspective of functional affordance to enhance the understanding of the value of algorithmic HRM. Design/methodology/approach - A systematic literature review was conducted in this study based on 283 articles. The articles are extracted from the Web of Science and Scopus. The content of the articles was then integrated to formulate the framework for this study. Findings - Functional affordance highlights algorithmic HRM can be systematically embedded within the organizational environment, with its characteristics naturally suggesting the functionalities or actions available for HR managers to choose from. The findings of this study demonstrate five features of algorithmic HRM from the perspective of functional affordance: awareness of algorithmic HRM, alignment with business model design, action readiness, adaptation to business context and attribution to individuality. Originality/value - This study provides a novel perspective for understanding the insufficiently theorized application of algorithmic HRM within organizations. It presents an integrated framework that elucidates the key features of algorithmic HRM and elaborates on how organizations can better develop algorithm-driven capabilities based on functional affordance.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1108/PR-03-2023-0218;The negative spillover effect of sandwich-generation caregiving on employees' job satisfaction: does work time matter?. PurposeThis study aims to investigate the effect of sandwich-generation caregiving (caregiving for elders and children simultaneously) on employed caregivers' job satisfaction when compared with non-sandwich caregiving patterns of no caregiving, children-only caregiving and elders-only caregiving. This study also aims to explore whether depression mediates this effect and whether three types of caregivers-friendly work time (less work-time length, less nonstandard work-time schedule and more work-time autonomy) buffer these direct and indirect effects.Design/methodology/approachA sample of 7,571 Chinese employees is chosen from the 2020 China Family Panel Studies through a multistage stratified sampling design.FindingsAfter controlling for employees' sociodemographic, work and other caregiving characteristics, this study finds that sandwich-generation caregiving is indeed more likely to negatively affect employees' job satisfaction when compared with no caregiving and elders-only caregiving, but to the same extent as children-only caregiving. This study also suggests that the effect of sandwich-generation caregiving on job satisfaction is mediated by employees' depression and that three types of caregiver-friendly work time help to weaken the negative effects on employees' depression and job satisfaction.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to explore the negative spillover effect and its mechanisms of caregiving on employees' job satisfaction through focusing on a special caregivers group: employed sandwich-generation caregivers. These results shed light on the importance of extending caregiver studies to the workplace and provide implications for organization managers and human resources practitioners to design caregiver-friendly workplace policies to maintain employed caregivers' work-family balance.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2022-0343;In the eye of the beholder: the role of self-perceived status in the relationship between high-performance work systems and affective commitment. PurposeResearch has suggested that employees interpret high-performance work systems (HPWSs) as targeting two distinct organizational objectives: enhancing performance and promoting employee well-being. These attributions often exert divergent effects on employee attitudes. Thus, this study aims to investigate this dynamic within the context of the Korean nursing occupation, clarifying how the HPWS can simultaneously evoke dual attributions: human resource (HR) well-being and HR performance attributions. Additionally, the authors examine the contrasting effects of these attributions and identify a moderating variable that could reconcile them. Drawing on the psychological experience of status theory, the authors conceptualize and test the moderating effect of employees' self-perceived status on the relationship between HR performance attribution and affective commitment.Design/methodology/approachData were collected from 475 nurses in 82 work units in Korean hospitals. Hypotheses were tested in a multilevel moderated mediation model.FindingsThe findings revealed that an HPWS elicits HR well-being and HR performance attributions. While HR well-being attribution was positively associated with affective commitment, HR performance attribution was positively related to affective commitment when employees' self-perceived status was high. Moreover, the HPWS demonstrated an indirect relationship with affective commitment via increasing HR performance attribution when self-perceived status was high.Originality/valueAlthough the personal meaning of HR attributions differs depending on the perceiver's situation, this aspect has received little attention in the field of research. This study advances the understanding of HR attributions derived from the HPWS within the specific context of Korean nursing. Furthermore, the authors suggest that the two attributions may not conflict with each other, indicating that the impact of HR performance attribution is conditional on an individual's self-perceived status.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2023-0121;Understanding the role of meaningfulness of work: a moderated-mediation model of bullying during work from home. PurposeDrawing on conservation of resource (COR) theory, the authors investigated relationships between bullying during work from home, turnover intention and meaningfulness of work among home-based teleworkers.Design/methodology/approachThe authors used three-wave data from 212 home-based teleworkers to investigate the authors' hypotheses.FindingsFindings reveal that bullying during home-based teleworking exacerbates teleworkers' emotional exhaustion and intention to quit. Further, the authors also found that the interrelationship between bullying during work from home and the intention to leave was positively moderated by the meaningfulness of work.Originality/valueThe authors' research helps understand how bullying stimulates teleworkers' turnover intention. Further, the authors find a counterintuitive impact of the meaningfulness of work on the relationship between bullying during work and turnover intention.

10.1108/PR-10-2022-0730;Getting along and getting ahead: voice trails of status pursuit. Purpose- Integrating individual and relational centric voice literature, the authors draw on self-presentation theory to analyse the role of status pursuit in employee voice. Status pursuit is believed to be ubiquitous as it is linked to access to scarce resources and social order pecking.Design/methodology/approach- The authors present a cross-level conceptual model outlining relational nuances of employee status pursuit that drive upward voice.Findings- The model integrates status pursuit with peer- and leader-related facets, focusing on three targets of voice: immediate leader (supervisor), diagonal leader (supervisor of another team/unit) and co-workers. The model highlights how employee voice can be directed to diverse targets, and depending on interpersonal attributes, how it serves as underlying links for upward voice.Originality/value- While employee voice can help to address important workplace concerns, it can also be used to advance employees' self-interest. Though there is a wealth of research on the importance of employee voice to organisational performance and individual wellbeing, especially through collective representation such as trade unions, there is a lack of literature on how employees navigate the social-relational work setting to promote their interests and develop status.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2021-0463;Engaging the age-diverse workforce: the interplay between personal and contextual resources. Purpose The purpose of this study was to advance research on work-related well-being and age by using a life-span approach to investigate the relationship between mastery goal orientation and work engagement during various age periods. The authors further tested whether a perceived motivational climate moderated the proposed relationships, and whether the nature of the moderation differed between age groups. Design/methodology/approach The authors utilized a two-wave, web-based questionnaire survey and collected data from 838 employees in the financial sector in Norway. Multiple regressions and PROCESS macro were used to test these hypotheses. Findings The authors found that both work engagement and mastery goal orientation differed across age groups and that the relationship between mastery goal orientation and work engagement was stronger for older than for younger ages. The results further support the moderating role of a motivational climate. Whereas a perceived mastery climate moderated the relationship between mastery goal orientation and work engagement for older workers, a perceived performance climate moderated the suggested relationship for younger workers. Originality/value The study extends research on work engagement in an age-diverse workforce by applying a life-span approach to the interplay between person and contextual elements in fostering work engagement. Furthermore, the study involved investigating factors that may inhibit or enhance the link between mastery orientation and work engagement for various age groups, which is important given work engagement's link to central work outcomes.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-09-2020-0715;Flourishing-at-work and turnover intentions: does trust in management moderate the relationship?. Purpose Based on the theoretical underpinnings of the theory of work adjustment and social exchange framework, the authors contend that an employee's trust in management (TIM) will interact with the flourishing-at-work (FAW) to predict turnover intentions (TIs). Specifically, the authors assumed that FAW will have a stronger negative effect on TIs, given the greater degree of TIM. Design/methodology/approach Leveraging a cross-sectional survey design and data gathered from 587 IT professionals working in India, the findings revealed that FAW negatively predicted TIs. More importantly, TIM accentuates or moderates the negative relationship between FAW and TIs. Findings Specifically, TIM was found to have a significant moderating effect on the relationship between (1) psychological well-being (PWB) and TIs, (2) social well-being and TIs. Interestingly, a nonsignificant moderating effect was observed on the relationship between emotional well-being (EWB) and TIs. Research limitations/implications The research findings of this study might be context-specific as the IT industry in India generally has high attrition, so obviously, a higher TIs is expected from IT professionals. Therefore, future studies should explore a different industry may be manufacturing and so on, to test the current study's research framework. Practical implications These are highly important contributions to the extant scholarship on FAW, as the study offers new wisdom into how FAW influences TIs under the contingent effect of TIM. Originality/value This is the first of its kind study to explore the moderating role of TIM on the link between FAW and employees' TIs.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-08-2020-0658;Employment expectations: examining the effect of psychological contract fulfillment on bridge employees' personal and work attitudes. Purpose In this study the authors examine whether bridge employees tend to hold non-standard jobs, and if so, whether non-standard job choice is deliberate. Moreover, the authors examine whether fulfillment of employment expectations affects the personal and work attitudes of bridge employees. Design/methodology/approach The authors' research and hypotheses are supported and developed through psychological contract theory. The authors collected data from 195 bridge employees, employed in a variety of jobs, through an online survey. Hypotheses were tested using hierarchical multiple regression. Findings This study suggests that some bridge employees may engage in non-standard employment deliberately. Moreover, we show that fulfillment of perceived obligation by employers (psychological contract) is associated with personal and work attitudes (life satisfaction, job satisfaction, affective commitment, normative commitment and intentions to stay) of bridge employees. Research limitations/implications While this study supports psychological contract theory as an important framework for understanding bridge employment, sample size, cross-sectional data and a lack of diversity in the sample limit causality, generalizability and data robustness. Future research should strive to replicate and extend the current findings. Practical implications The present study underlines the importance of designing jobs to meet the expectations of bridge employees. Also, it highlights the preference of bridge employees to engage in non-standard employment. Originality/value The authors extend bridge employment research by empirically examining the relationship between unmet employment expectations and the personal and work attitudes of bridge employees.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2020-0414;Linking organisational values and sustainability: the role of AMO practices. Purpose The aim of this study was to analyse the link between the values that govern the functioning of cooperatives and their sustainability. Furthermore, the authors propose that this relationship is mediated by AMO (ability, motivation and opportunity) practices, which generate different behaviours and attitudes in their employees, thus strengthening the message of sustainable management that the directors of this kind of companies aim to transmit. Design/methodology/approach This article presents a theoretical and empirical research model about the relationship between organisational values, AMO practices and sustainability in social economy firms. The proposed model was tested using the multivariate method of partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) with a sample of 124 cooperative companies. The information was gathered through a questionnaire with questions composed of measurement scales that had been previously validated by the reference literature. Findings This work empirically demonstrates that the perceived support, respect and responsibility values are strongly related to sustainability, and that ability and opportunity-enhancing practices mediate the association of perceived support and responsibility with the sustainability of cooperatives. Originality/value This work contributes to covering the lack of studies about which values support and impact the sustainability of organisations, and it provides information about the mediating role of certain AMO practices in the search for a more sustainable organisation, demonstrating that some practices are more relevant than others.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2021-0042;I'm difficult, but not impossible: how millennials view international assignments and the implications for human resource management (HRM). Purpose The purpose of this study is to identify what (de)motivates millennial students from undertaking mobility upon graduation and whether this depends on gender, region of origin, prior work experience, level of studies, or international mindset and how. The paper provides insights on the preferred length of mobility and the most (un)attractive regions. Design/methodology/approach The sample consists of 1,001 millennial students from 77 countries. Data from a quantitative self-reported survey were analysed employing exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory data analyses. Findings Factors that motivate mobility are personal development, learning about foreign cultures and the opportunity to travel and those that demotivate are a preference for short-term assignments, unwillingness of family to move and disruption of home country life. Factors differ by region, gender, level of current studies and the student's international mindset. Research limitations/implications The cohort included only students pursuing a business or technical education. A willingness to accept an international assignment may not necessarily translate into accepting an international assignment due to the effect of the attitude-behaviour gap. The authors do not aim to generalise on the basis of the results since the sample was fairly disproportionate in terms of world regions. We do, however, invite further studies to treat ours as potential input for new and emerging studies of either a quantitative or qualitative nature. Practical implications Due to a strong attachment to home, short-term assignments are preferred. Salary and financial benefits remain hygienic factors and motivating factors remain on the soft side. Motivating millennials to engage in mobility requires an individualised approach, dependent on region of origin, gender, the level of education, work experience and international mindset. Originality/value This study indicates that the factors that (de)motivate millennial students to engage in international assignments differ on the basis of various socio-demographic variables.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-07-2019-0375;Board busyness and firm productivity. Purpose Prior studies provide mixed evidence on the association of board busyness and firm productivity. Thus, this paper empirically analyzes how board busyness affects firm productivity. Design/methodology/approach To measure board busyness, this paper computes the percentage of directors on a board who sit on three or more boards. Furthermore, to calculate firm productivity, the paper employs data envelopment analysis. Findings Findings demonstrate that the association of board busyness and firm productivity (association) is generally negative and statistically significant but economically insignificant. In this respect, the findings reveal that the association is negative (positive) and both statistically and economically significant for firms having higher monitoring (advising) needs. Moreover, the findings demonstrate that regulatory oversight (1) weakens the general negative association;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2020-0296;Developing job performance: mediation of occupational commitment and achievement striving with competence enhancement as a moderator. Purpose This study draws upon the theory of eudaimonic motivation to develop a model that explains job performance in high-tech industry. This study aims to clarify through what mediating mechanism employees' social interaction and self-efficacy can substantially influence their job performance. At the same time, competence enhancement is examined as a moderator that influences the effects of social interaction and self-efficacy. Design/methodology/approach The hypotheses developed in this study were empirically tested by collecting three-source data from a leading international business company in Taiwan's high-tech industry. The survey data of this study were first analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis and hierarchical regression analysis for testing the hypotheses of the study. Post hoc tests were then performed using structural equation modeling and bootstrapping analysis for the purpose of double verifications. Findings This study finds that social interaction and self-efficacy relate to job performance via the full mediation of occupational commitment and achievement striving. Besides, the relationship between social interaction and occupational commitment is positively moderated by competence enhancement, while the relationship between self-efficacy and occupational commitment is negatively moderated by competence enhancement. Originality/value This work shows important findings that complement previous research on personnel performance and competence. First, this work confirms that social interaction and self-efficacy play critical roles for indirectly influencing job performance through the full mediation of occupational commitment and achievement striving among engineers in high-tech industry. Second, the moderating effects of competence enhancement on the relationships between social interaction and occupational commitment and between self-efficacy and occupational commitment are confirmed by this study.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2019-0213;Why do employees struggle to thrive in the workplaces? A look at the impact of abusive supervision. Purpose Based on the conservation of resources view, the objective of this paper is to examine the relationship between abusive supervision and workplace thriving. Further, this study investigates the underlying mechanisms role of agentic work behaviors (i.e. task focus, heedful relating) and moderating role of employee's core self-evaluations. Design/methodology/approach Using a time-lag approach, data are collected from 360 full-time employees enrolled in an executive development program in a large university of China. To test the proposed model, data analysis is carried out through Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) and Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS). Findings The results show that abusive supervision negatively influences workplace thriving. Further, the findings also confirm the mediating role of agentic work behaviors and the moderating role of core self-evaluations between the relationship of abusive supervision and thriving. Practical implications Based on study findings, this study draws the attention of managers toward the new deleterious outcomes of abusive supervision. Hence, to nurture a thriving workforce, organizations should keep abusive behaviors under keen observations to minimize their frequent occurrences. Further, it is proposed that hiring employees with higher core self-evaluations can mitigate the injurious effect of abusive supervision. Originality/value This is the first attempt to our knowledge to untapped the abusive supervision-thriving relationship via the underlying mechanisms of two agentic work behavior's and core self-evaluations as a moderator enriches the extant body of knowledge and provide valuable insight into the abusive supervision and workplace thriving literature.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22169;Advancing the sustainability agenda through strategic human resource management: Insights and suggestions for future research. How can human resource management (HRM), as both a scholarly discourse and a corporate strategic function, advance the sustainability agenda? We endeavor to answer this question by drawing together insights gleamed from the emerging sustainable HRM literature. First, we synthesize various conceptualizations and theoretical perspectives on the topic, including frames of reference from strategic HRM, institutional theory and institutional logics, stakeholder theory, and sustainable careers/life cycle theory. Second, we unpack and contextualize the sustainable HRM literature through the lens of international HRM. Third, we consolidate the extant literature and present an agenda for future research, calling for further exploration of topics that are likely to hit the next high wave of generating new strategic HRM insights and sustainable HRM knowledge.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Work in the gig economy is championed by platform organizations as affording individuals the flexibility to decide when, where, and how much they wish to work. The reality is more complex. In app-based gig work, we propose the concept of algorithmic HRM control, which acts as an omnipresent and distinctive control system that differs from traditional forms of control in two significant ways: first, the reliance upon, and pervasiveness of, algorithmic technologies in its enactment;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1002/hrm.22104;Team boundary work and team workload demands: Their interactive effect on team vigor and team effectiveness. Drawing from team-level job demands-resources theory, we hypothesize that team workload demands moderate the positive link between team boundary work (i.e., boundary spanning and boundary buffering) and team effectiveness (i.e., team innovation and team performance), such that boundary work is more beneficial for team effectiveness when teams face higher team workload demands. Furthermore, we predict that this interaction occurs through increased team vigor, where team vigor is defined as an affective emergent state characterized by positive valences and high activation levels experienced by team members. We largely find support for our model across two field studies: a cross-sectional survey using three independent data sources (89 automotive research and development teams, including 724 team members, 89 team leaders and 18 managers) and a time-lagged survey using two independent data sources (139 teams working in a Chinese utility company, including 640 team members and 139 team leaders). Our article contributes to team research by broadening our understanding of when and how team boundary work is associated with greater team effectiveness.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22081;Assessing job crafting competencies to predict tradeoffs between competing outcomes. We introduce the job crafting competency construct and apply it to predict tradeoffs between competing outcomes that are inherent in job crafting, like performance and well-being or engagement and withdrawal. Job crafting competencies are the clusters of individual knowledge, skills, and abilities that are necessary to achieve personal objectives through effective job crafting problem-solving. We create a framework of job crafting competencies consisting of comprehensive/simplistic heuristic information use and approach/avoidance problem-solving skills. In Study 1, we operationalize competencies as profiles demonstrated through an aptitude-oriented assessment that predicts differences in outcomes. Five distinct profiles emerged in a sample of 174 workers. The high-volume analytic problem-solving profile was associated with higher performance and strain, while the ambivalent acquiescence profile was associated with lower performance and strain. The practical problem-solving profile minimized tradeoffs between performance and strain. Rapid problem-solving and low-volume analytic problem-solving profiles were variants in between these other patterns. Study 2 used a survey of 323 workers to support the uniqueness of the five competencies, and their relationships with approach/avoidance job crafting, engagement, and withdrawal. The research identifies a new job crafting individual difference (job crafting competencies) to delineate outcomes and tradeoffs according to unique competency profiles.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22192;A skills-matching perspective on talent management: Developing strategic agility. Despite two decades of evolution as an area of research and practice, talent management faces ongoing criticism for being overly static in its approach, offering little in terms of enabling strategic agility. This is problematic as organizations increasingly rely on strategic agility to manage their dynamic business operations. Drawing on matching theory and adopting an agility lens, we explore the link between talent management and strategic agility. Through a qualitative research design, encompassing 34 interviews in 15 organizations, we explicate a skills-matching perspective on talent management, including initial and dynamic skills-matching in external and internal labor markets. Through this process, organizations can build a set of dynamic capabilities, underlying two meta-capabilities, strategic sensitivity and resource fluidity, which enable strategic agility. In doing so, we portray skills-matching as an illustration of a processual view on talent management and create a model of developing strategic agility through skills-matching, responsive to external and internal demands.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22148;Toward a more sustainable environment: Understanding why and when green training promotes employees' eco-friendly behaviors outside of work. Although green training has been shown in past research to promote environmentally responsible behaviors at work, scholars have paid less attention to its influence on employees' eco-friendly behaviors outside of work. This omission is critical because confining green training research to the work domain obscures its benefits in promoting employees' pro-environmental behaviors beyond the workplace, and thus its role in supporting organizational efforts to conserve the natural environment. To address this gap, we examine the direct and indirect (via connectedness to nature) relationships between green training and employees' eco-friendly behaviors outside of work, including consumption of eco-friendly products, reuse of items and materials, and reduced consumption of resources such as water, electricity, and paper. We also examine the moderating influence of intrinsic spirituality on the direct link between green training and connectedness to nature, as well as the indirect link between green training and eco-friendly behaviors beyond the workplace. Using time-lagged, multisource data, we find support for our hypotheses. Our findings advance knowledge on the important yet largely overlooked role of green training in shaping employees' environmentally responsible behaviors outside of the workplace.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2023-0104;Free to have imbalance? Freelancers' work-life balance and the moderating role of three key work facets. Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to enrich the HRM literature on freelancers' work-life balance. To do so, we investigate the difference in freelance and employed journalists' work-life balance and the moderating role of work-scheduling autonomy, job-income security and collegial informational support, drawing on a theory novel to the HRM literature, that is, the Stress of Higher Status Theory. Design/methodology/approach-Data were collected with a survey questionnaire that was administered to a sample of 1,166journalists,including118 freelancers, in Norway in 2021.We analysed this data using a stepwise regression analysis. Findings-We report three main findings: First, we find evidence indicating that freelance journalists have less work-life balance than employed journalists. Second, our results provide support for the Stress of Higher Status Theory and testify to the relevance this theory has for high-skill workers. Third, only collegial support significantly(positively)moderates freelancers' work-life balance. Originality/value-This study adds to the existing literature on freelancing and work-life balance, demonstrating that individuals' work arrangements have the potential to shape their work facets and work-life balance. The theoretical and practical implications of this are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-08-2023-0642;Increased demand for in-home aged care impeded by a lack of HRM supports for in-home care workers: a scoping review. Purpose The purpose of the scoping review is to develop understandings around the high demand for in-home healthcare for the aged and how to find ways to better support declining numbers of in-home care workers and healthcare professionals. The scoping review highlights the role of human resource management (HRM) in this sector. Design/methodology/approach This scoping review of literature takes a systematic approach to identify themes on the aged care sector and levels of support for in-home care. We map the literature from specific databases to find themes. Findings It is important for HRM of aged care service providers to understand the key issues around homecare workers and healthcare professionals. There are key issues for stakeholders, such as clients' health needs, organizations struggling to recruit and retain healthcare workers, and it is critical to know how such issues impact on clients and the healthcare workforce. Originality/value There is a dearth of literature on in-home care for the aged, and therefore, we contribute to understandings about the competing pressures surrounding the demand for in-home care versus the declining number of homecare workers and professional healthcare workers in this sector. We highlight the lack of HRM support from aged care providers and the impact on homecare workers.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2023-0300;AI and the metaverse in the workplace: DEI opportunities and challenges. Purpose - The metaverse, through artificial intelligence (AI) systems and capabilities, allows considerable data analysis in the workplace, largely exceeding traditional people analytics data collection. While concerns over surveillance and issues associated with privacy and discrimination have been raised, the metaverse has the potential to offer opportunities associated with fairer assessment of employee performance and enhancement of the employee experience, especially with respect to gender and race, inclusiveness and workplace equity. This paper aims at shedding light on the diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) opportunities and challenges of implementing the metaverse in the workplace, and the role played by AI. Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws on our past research on AI and the metaverse and provides insights addressed to human resources (HR) scholars and practitioners. Findings - Our analysis of AI applications to the metaverse in the workplace sheds light on the ambivalent role of and potential trade-offs that may arise with this emerging technology. If used responsibly, the metaverse can enable positive changes concerning the future of work, which can promote DEI. Yet, the same technology can lead to negative DEI outcomes if implementations occur quickly, unsupervised and with a sole focus on efficiencies and productivity (i.e. collecting metrics, models etc.). Practical implications - Managers and HR leaders should try to be first movers rather than followers when deciding if (or, better, when) to implement metaverse capabilities in their organizations. But how the metaverse is implemented will be strategic. This involves choices concerning the degree of invasive/pervasive monitoring (internal) as well as make or buy decisions concerning outsourcing AI capabilities. Originality/value - Our paper is one among few (to date) that discusses AI capabilities in the metaverse at the intersection of the HR and information systems(IS) literature and that specifically tackles DEI issues. Also, we take a balanced approach when evaluating the metaverse from a DEI perspective. While most studies either demonize or celebrate these technologies from an ethical and DEI standpoint, we aim to highlight challenges and opportunities, with the goal to guide scholars and practitioners towards a responsible use of the metaverse in organizations.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1108/PR-11-2021-0780;The antecedents of career change intention in middle-level managers: the role of job and career satisfaction. Purpose This investigates the interrelationships between job and career satisfaction and career change intention through the extension of the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Design/methodology/approach The data for the study is collected from 219 top and middle-level managers and analyzed through partial least squares path structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings Findings indicate that job and career satisfaction have a significant and negative impact on personal attitude toward career change and subjective norms, whereas all three constructs of the TPB influence the intention to change career. In addition, the mediation of personal attitude and subjective norm pathways were found to be significant for both job and career satisfaction and career change intention relationships, while no mediation effect was identified for the perceived behavior control construct of the TPB. Research limitations/implications The results suggest important theoretical and practical implications. First, a novel model of mediation between job and career satisfaction and the intention to turn away from an existing career is introduced between job and career satisfaction and career change intention associations for testing the full TPB framework. Practical implications The findings imply that the impact of cognitive factors, including having a positive opinion about the potential outcomes of switching to a new career, the level of pressure exerted by significant third parties about making a career change, and the self-belief about making this change happen should be closely investigated when examining the determinants of career change intention. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first empirical research study that tests the impact of the determinants of TPB on career change intention within a sample of professional managers from an emerging economy context.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2021-0343;Can HRM predict mental health crises? Using HR analytics to unpack the link between employment and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Purpose The aim of this research is to determine the extent to which the human resource (HR) function can screen and potentially predict suicidal employees and offer preventative mental health assistance. Design/methodology/approach Drawing from the 2019 National Survey of Drug Use and Health (N = 56,136), this paper employs multivariate binary logistic regression to model the work-related predictors of suicidal ideation, planning and attempts. Findings The results indicate that known periods of joblessness, the total number of sick days and absenteeism over the last 12 months are significantly associated with various suicidal outcomes while controlling for key psychosocial correlates. The results also indicate that employee assistance programs are associated with a significantly reduced likelihood of suicidal ideation. These findings are consistent with conservation of resources theory. Research limitations/implications This research demonstrates preliminarily that the HR function can unobtrusively detect employee mental health crises by collecting data on key predictors. Originality/value In the era of COVID-19, employers have a duty of care to safeguard employee mental health. To this end, the authors offer an innovative way through which the HR function can employ predictive analytics to address mental health crises before they result in tragedy.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-09-2020-0676;Dynamics of millennial employees' communicative behaviors in the workplace: the role of inclusive leadership and symmetrical organizational communication. Purpose With a focus on millennial employees, this study investigates how employees engage in two types of employees' communicative behaviors (ECBs), that is, their voluntary communicative efforts to acquire and circulate tasks and managerial information (i.e. scouting) and to share and discuss positive and negative aspects of their organization with internal members (i.e. internal megaphoning). Through the lens of social exchange theory (SET) and symmetrical communication model, this study examines the effects of inclusive leadership and internal communication on active information behaviors of employees within their companies. Design/methodology/approach An online survey was conducted with fulltime millennial employees working across various industry sectors in the US. Findings Symmetrical internal communication influenced by inclusive leadership enhances employees' scouting behavior as well as positive internal megaphoning behavior. Positive and negative internal megaphoning with supervisors increases the scouting behavior of employees, whereas negative internal megaphoning with peers does not have a significant effect. Originality/value This study is among the first attempts to examine the effectiveness of leadership and strategic internal communication on millennial employees' diverse types of communicative behaviors.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2021-0026;The role of supervisor support for strengths use in promoting perceived employability and career satisfaction. Purpose This study aims to examine how perceived supervisor support for strengths use (PSSSU) directly and indirectly facilitates career satisfaction and perceived employability as mediated by strengths use behavior. Design/methodology/approach A two-wave questionnaire survey was administered to nurses (n = 221) and analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings Results indicated that PSSSU directly enhanced career satisfaction and indirectly enhanced perceived employability through strengths use behavior. Research limitations/implications As the sample was limited to nurses in a Japanese hospital, it is possible that the characteristics of the national culture and occupation affected the results. Practical implications Support for strengths use is important especially in stressful work environments in order to retain professional employees by enhancing their employability and career satisfaction. Originality/value This study extends the literature by identifying the different effects of PSSSU on the two types of career-related well-being. The present research is the first study to show the mediating role played by strengths use behavior in linking PSSSU to perceived employability.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-11-2020-0835;Policy and practical implications for workforce nationalization in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Purpose This study aims to advance practice and research on workforce nationalization in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries through identifying relevant policy and practical implications needed to implement nationalization initiatives effectively. Design/methodology/approach The author followed a two-stage approach. Stage 1 reviewed the literature to identify relevant papers on workforce nationalization in the GCC region. Stage 2 used a thematic analysis to propose relevant implications for both policy makers and employers. Findings Through the lens of four perspectives at different levels, i.e. legal, organizational, human development and socio-cultural perspectives, the author has identified ten policy and practical implications. Both governments and employers need to consider these when developing holistic strategies for effective workforce nationalization. Originality/value Over several decades, the GCC countries have been implementing several nationalization initiatives to increase the percentage and qualifications of their national employees. The significance of these initiatives stems from the fact that the GCC countries lack adequately trained citizens. Moreover, regardless of political attitudes toward foreigners, development plans for modernization, industrialization or urbanization heavily relies on foreign employees. This is because nationals represent the minority of employees and are largely employed in the public sector. This phenomenon needs the attention of scholars to discuss different aspects of nationalization and how to effectively implement it.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-09-2023-0783;Beyond performance and potential in talent management: exploring the impact of mobility on talent designation. Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to contribute to a grounded understanding of how mobility impacts talent designation and with what consequences. Design/methodology/approach - An exploratory qualitative case study was conducted of a global medical technology corporation, based on interviews with HR managers, line managers and non-managerial employees. Findings - The findings illustrate that mobility plays a significant role in how employees are assigned talent status, and that mobility manifests and impacts talent designation through two types - geographical and lateral mobility. Mobility is not determined based on abilities and competencies, but rather on an employee's overall personal situation, including age, family status and relationship status. Two main practices emerged through which these determinants were decided: direct questioning and guesswork. The consequences that follow are that individuals are left with little room to influence their own talent situation, and that there is a risk of discriminatory and exclusionary consequences arising. Originality/value - The study makes two main contributions. First, it provides a more nuanced understanding of how talent designation unfolds in practice, showing that performance and potential alone cannot explain the process and emphasizing the consequential role of mobility. Second, it contributes with knowledge about the consequences of basing talent designation heavily on mobility. Individual employees are left with significantly less room for enacting agency and playing active roles in relation to TM than has been suggested. Added to this are the potential discriminatory and exclusionary consequences.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2024-0086;Exploring the careers of women with disabilities: a systematic review and implications for human resource management. Purpose - Although many organisations and governments internationally acknowledge that a diverse workforce is essential for improved decision-making, employee well-being and organisational performance and competitiveness, women with disabilities and their (potential) participation and contributions within organisations continue to be overlooked and under-researched. Examining the careers of women with disabilities through the lens of human resource management (HRM) allows for the development of policies and practices that support their inclusion and progression in the workforce and helps lay the foundation for legislative, institutional and organisational changes that address the unique challenges faced by this cohort. Design/methodology/approach - We conducted a comprehensive, systematic scoping review that analyses various career-related aspects for women with disabilities across different cultural and geographical contexts internationally. A two-stage review (Stage 1 - Title and abstract screening and Stage 2 - Full-text review) of the extant literature on the careers of women with disabilities yielded 80 relevant empirical articles. Findings - Our review identified four key career-related themes pertaining to women with disabilities: (1) Educational interventions and support for positive career outcomes of women with disabilities;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1108/PR-03-2021-0138;Full of energy - The relationship between supervisor developmental feedback and task performance: a conservation of resources perspective. Purpose Meaningful feedback at work signals effective performance management. Drawing on a new perspective of the conservation of resources (COR) theory, this paper aims to examine the mediating effect of relational energy in the relationship between supervisor developmental feedback and subordinates' task performance with the moderating role of learning demands. Design/methodology/approach Data from 230 supervisor-subordinate dyads were collected at two time points of four enterprises in China. Findings The results support the proposed mediation effect that supervisor developmental feedback positively predicts subordinates' task performance via boosting subordinates' relational energy. Furthermore, the results highlighted the moderating role of learning demands in the relationship between supervisor developmental feedback and subordinates' relational energy. The moderated-mediated relationship for subordinates' task performance was also supported. Originality/value Drawing on COR theory, this paper contributes to a complete understanding of how supervisor developmental feedback may support or build employees' relational energy, facilitating task performance and further exploring learning demands as a boundary condition of this indirect relationship.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-07-2021-0492;Reframing the performance management system: a conversations perspective. Purpose To explore human resource (HR) practitioner perspectives of the effectiveness, challenges, and aspirations of the performance management (PM) system to inform future directions for PM design and success. Design/methodology/approach Interviews with 53 HR practitioners from a cross-section of organisations operating in the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand. Findings Practitioner's discussed the criticality of effective conversations across all elements of the PM system. Using an interpretive approach, and through a lens of social exchange theory (SET), we used their voice to develop a conversations-based PM model. This model centres on effective performance conversations through the design and implementation of the PM system. It includes four enablers and five environmental elements. The enablers (aligned goals, frequent feedback, skills development, and formality) depend on skilled interactions and conversations, and the organisational environmental elements (design, development function, buy-in, culture, and linkage to other systems) are enhanced when effective conversations take place. Practical implications Practitioners can use the conversations model to help shape the way they design and implement PM systems, that place emphasis on upskilling participants to engage in both formal and informal honest conversations to build competency in the enablers and assess organisational readiness in terms of the environmental elements. Originality/value By listening to the under-utilised voice of the HR practitioner, and through a lens of SET, we developed a PM model which emphasises reciprocity and relationship building as key tenets of the PM system. While past research recognises the importance of effective conversations for PM implementation, it has largely silent been about the role of conversations in system design. Our model centres these conversations, presenting enablers and environmental elements to facilitate their core position within effective PM.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-08-2020-0640;Scan it, buy it, pay it - customers' psychological contracts as partial employees in retail. Purpose Self-service technologies (SST) have become more and more pervasive in retail to facilitate autonomous checkout. In this context, customers play an active role and, as such, can be considered as partial employees. Partial employees have to perform a wide range of tasks, get rewarded for their work and need to understand the terms of the exchange, all without being subject to a formalized contract. In this research, the authors suggest that partial employees go through a process of organizational socialization that allows them to define the psychological contract they hold with the organization. Design/methodology/approach In order to investigate the psychological contracts of partial employees, 324 Canadian customers using SST completed an online questionnaire, in which their SST use, psychological contract fulfillment and organizational socialization were measured. Findings Descriptive analyses highlight that customers as partial employees build a psychological contract with their most frequent retailer, as they perceive not only retailer inducements but also their own contributions. Multiple linear regressions suggest that organizational socialization favors psychological contract fulfillment, but that specific dimensions of organizational socialization are important for employer inducements vs. employee contributions. Moreover, results suggest that the frequency of use of SST as well as the patronage positively predicts psychological contract fulfillment. Originality/value This research investigates a specific situation of unconventional employment - that of customers as partial employees with organizations. It contributes to the literature on the psychological contract by broadening its application to new relations and to the literature on customer management by reemphasizing the relevance of the psychological contract in this domain.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2021-0459;Exploring layers of context-related work-from-home demands during COVID-19. Purpose This article identifies the contextual demands impacting the work from home (WFH) experience during the COVID-19 pandemic and considers their respective impact on employees' personal and work-related outcomes. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on a qualitative methodology, the authors thematically analyzed written narratives from 41 employees who had been required to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings Data analysis identified four layers of contextual demands (omnibus, task, social and personal) that had resulted in participants being required to work from home. Drawing on this finding, the authors develop a conceptual process model to extend current theory and explain how the respective demands impact individual affective reactions and work-related experiences, health and wellbeing. The authors' findings offer new insights into contexts where WFH becomes mandatory, indicating that it is characterized by a range of challenges and opportunities. Practical implications This paper signals the need to provide employees with a realistic preview of working from home demands, including interventions to better prepare them to navigate the daily stressors of working from home;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-12-2019-0656;Subdimensions of total rewards satisfaction and creativity among R&D employees: a moderated mediation model. Purpose This study aims to explore the relative importance of the subdimensions of total rewards satisfaction in predicting research and development (R&D) employee creativity. In addition, the study examines the indirect effects of the subdimensions of total rewards satisfaction on creativity via work engagement and the moderating role of challenge-related work stress in the first stage. Design/methodology/approach A two-wave design was used, in which total rewards satisfaction and challenge-related work stress were measured in the first wave. Work engagement and creativity were measured in the second wave. Dominance analysis and the latent moderated mediation model were used for the data analyses. Findings The analyses show that nonfinancial rewards satisfaction completely dominates indirect and direct financial rewards satisfaction when predicting creativity. Indirect financial rewards satisfaction completely dominates direct financial rewards satisfaction when predicting creativity. Work engagement mediates the relationships between the subdimensions of total rewards satisfaction and creativity. Challenge-related work stress moderates the relationships between the subdimensions of total rewards satisfaction and work engagement and the indirect effects of the subdimensions of total rewards satisfaction on creativity via work engagement. Practical implications The results imply that managers should set challenge demands for R&D employees and try to improve their total rewards satisfaction, especially their nonfinancial and indirect financial rewards satisfaction, for them to be more creative. Originality/value This empirical study contributes to the literature by comparing the relative importance of the different dimensions of total rewards satisfaction in predicting creativity. The study also clarifies how (through work engagement) and when (based on challenge-related work stress) the subdimensions of total rewards satisfaction are positively related to R&D employees' creativity.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Purpose This paper aims to investigate the impact of employee silence on performance and turnover intentions. In addition, it seeks to explore the mediating role of burnout in the link between employee silence, and three employee outcomes-supervisor-rated task/contextual performance and self-reported turnover intentions. Design/methodology/approach Using survey questionnaire design, this paper collected data from 508 telecom engineers and their immediate supervisors and analyzed the result using structural equation modeling (SEM) technique, bootstrapping. Findings Results reveal that employee silence leads to burnout which results in debilitating employee performance, increase in withdrawal behaviors and turnover intentions;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-07-2020-0507;Abrasive leaders who changed: learning from their experience. Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand the experience of three formerly abrasive leaders who improved their conduct and management strategies following a workplace intervention.Design/methodology/approach- Narrative inquiry, a personal and collaborative research method, revealed the experience of three leaders in their shift from destructive behaviors. Concepts from adult development, specifically Kegan's constructive-development theory (CDT) and Mezirow's transformative learning theory (TL), provided a lens to better understand the leaders' personal development.Findings - This study culminated with three co-composed narrative accounts and an analysis of narrative threads. The focus of this paper is the interpretive narrative thread analysis. The developmental experience of these three leaders included disruption, awakening and equipping.Research limitations/implications - This study included three leaders. The experience of these leaders may not be representative of other formerly abrasive leaders.Practical implications - This initial exploratory study contributes to CDT and TL by suggesting leader interpersonal development is an intensely emotional experience that transcends the mechanics of developmental stages. In practice, this study indicates abrasive leaders may improve their conduct and management strategies with organizational support, including supervisor intervention and specialized professionals.Originality/value - This paper offers insight for scholars and human resource (HR) professionals on the emotionally intense experiential journey of leaders who improved their interpersonal conduct. This study introduces concepts from CDT and TL into the study of workplace psychological aggression (WPA), and it expands the limited knowledge of how HR can support positive perpetrator change.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2020-0088;Yesterday's workers in Tomorrow's world. Purpose This study sought to examine the attitudes of blue-collar workers toward job automation. The study examined the relations between job automation, fear of job loss and self-actualization. Design/methodology/approach Using mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative analysis) with 539 participants overall, we examined employees' attitudes toward job automation through two separate studies conducted in a large public organization that employs blue-, white- and pink-collar employees. The blue-collar workers who participated consisted of waste collectors, gardeners and parking supervisors whose work is at risk of job automation. Findings We found that 74% of the blue-collar employees described technology as a replacer that simplifies and reduces human work activities, while only 3% perceived it as an enabler that could enrich their jobs and expand human potential. Fifty-three percent of the employees in the white-collar professions described technology as a replacer, and 36% perceived it as an enabler. Among pink-collar workers, 51% perceived technology as an enabler, while only 14% perceived it as a replacer. A positive relationship between job automation and self-actualization was evident for pink- and white-collar workers, but not for blue-collar workers. Originality/value This study sheds light on how employees in different types of jobs perceive technological advancements at work. A classification of the perception of technology as an enabler vs a replacer is presented. The relationships between job automation and self-actualization in different job types are explored.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-12-2019-0680;The ethics of people analytics: risks, opportunities and recommendations. Purpose This research analyzed the existing academic and grey literature concerning the technologies and practices of people analytics (PA), to understand how ethical considerations are being discussed by researchers, industry experts and practitioners, and to identify gaps, priorities and recommendations for ethical practice. Design/methodology/approach An iterative scoping review method was used to capture and synthesize relevant academic and grey literature. This is suited to emerging areas of innovation where formal research lags behind evidence from professional or technical sources. Findings Although the grey literature contains a growing stream of publications aimed at helping PA practitioners to be ethical, overall, research on ethical issues in PA is still at an early stage. Optimistic and technocentric perspectives dominate the PA discourse, although key themes seen in the wider literature on digital/data ethics are also evident. Risks and recommendations for PA projects concerned transparency and diverse stakeholder inclusion, respecting privacy rights, fair and proportionate use of data, fostering a systemic culture of ethical practice, delivering benefits for employees, including ethical outcomes in business models, ensuring legal compliance and using ethical charters. Research limitations/implications This research adds to current debates over the future of work and employment in a digitized, algorithm-driven society. Practical implications The research provides an accessible summary of the risks, opportunities, trade-offs and regulatory issues for PA, as well as a framework for integrating ethical strategies and practices. Originality/value By using a scoping methodology to surface and analyze diverse literatures, this study fills a gap in existing knowledge on ethical aspects of PA. The findings can inform future academic research, organizations using or considering PA products, professional associations developing relevant guidelines and policymakers adapting regulations. It is also timely, given the increase in digital monitoring of employees working from home during the Covid-19 pandemic.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2020-0247;Human resource analytics: a review and bibliometric analysis. Purpose This paper aims to identify the current research trends and set the future research agenda in the area of human resource (HR) analytics by an extensive review of the existing literature. The paper aims to capture state of the art and develop an exhaustive understanding of the theoretical foundations, concepts and recent developments in the area. Design/methodology/approach A portfolio of 125 articles collected from the Scopus database was systematically analyzed using a two-tier method. First, the evolution, current state of the literature and research clusters are identified using bibliometric techniques. Finally, using content analysis, the research clusters are studied to develop the future research agenda. Findings Based on the bibliometric analysis, network analysis and content analysis techniques, this study provides a comprehensive review of the existing literature. The study also highlights future research themes by identifying knowledge gaps based on content analysis of research clusters. Research limitations/implications The evolution and the current state of the HR analytics literature are presented. Some specific research questions are also provided to help future research. Originality/value This study enriches the literature of HR analytics by integrating bibliometric analysis and content analysis to develop a more systematic and exhaustive understanding of the research area. The findings of this study may assist fellow researchers in furthering their research in the identified research clusters.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-09-2022-0636;The internal synergy effect of the dual-oriented HRM system on employee ethical behaviors. PurposeMore and more literature points out that compared to fragmented strategic HRM, interactive or internally consistent HR systems can generate synergies and more effectively predict employee outcomes. Different HR subsystems (such as performance-oriented and maintenance-oriented HRM practices), respectively, play a critical role for organizations and employees. However, the impact of the synergy effect of different practices within the HRM system is less concerning to researchers. Based on self-regulation theory, this paper explores the congruence effects within the dual-oriented HR system on employee ethical behaviors (prosocial/unethical behavior).Design/methodology/approachData were collected in a two-wave survey from 252 employees working in high-tech and service companies in China. Polynomial regression and response surface analyses were used to examine the hypotheses.FindingsThe results indicate that the internal congruence of performance-oriented and maintenance-oriented HRM practices is positively related to employees' prosocial behavior but negatively related to employees' unethical behavior. Employees have more prosocial behavior and less unethical behavior when they perceive the high-performance-oriented and high-maintenance-oriented HRM practices than the low-performance-oriented and low-maintenance-oriented HRM practices. Employees also have more prosocial behavior and less unethical behavior when they perceive the low performance-oriented and high maintenance-oriented HRM practices than the high performance-oriented and low maintenance-oriented HRM practices.Originality/valueDrawing on self-regulation theory and the Yin-Yang balancing perspective, this paper extends the limited understanding of the influence of dual-oriented HR system internal congruence between performance-oriented and maintenance-oriented HRM practices on employee behaviors. This paper is of great significance for a better understanding of the complexity and potential of HR systems.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2023-0303;Impact of organisational facilitators and perceived HR effectiveness on acceptance of AI-augmented HRM: an integrated TAM and TPB perspective. PurposeDrawing on the integrative perspective of the technology acceptance model (TAM) and theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and extending it further by examining the role of organisational facilitators and perceived HR effectiveness in this integrative perspective, we examine HR professionals' AI-augmented HRM (HRM(AI)) acceptance in this research.Design/methodology/approachThe data (N=375) were collected from HR professionals working in different organisations in India. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was employed to analyse the data.FindingsThe results of the study suggest that along with organisational facilitator antecedents to the relevant components of both TAM and TPB, perceived HR effectiveness also enhanced the HRM(AI) acceptance levels of HR professionals.Practical implicationsThe research findings are expected to contribute to the understanding of the factors that influence the acceptance of AI-augmented HRM in organizations. The results may also help organisations to identify the facilitators that can enhance the adoption and implementation of AI-augmented HRM by HR professionals. Finally, the study provides a composite TAM-TPB theoretical framework that can guide future research on the acceptance of AI-augmented HRM.Originality/valueTo the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to factor in the effect of contextual factors (i.e. organisational facilitators and perceived HR effectiveness) in the TAM and TPB equations.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2023-0080;The relationship between objective overqualification, perceived overqualification and job satisfaction: employment opportunity matters. PurposeThe purpose of this study is to investigate the boundary conditions between objective overqualification and perceived overqualification. In addition, we aim to investigate the mediation patterns between objective overqualification, perceived overqualification and job satisfaction.Design/methodology/approachA two-wave survey was conducted with 382 new entrants of job market. Data was analyzed with Process 3.5 in SPSS 26.0 to test the hypothesized moderated mediation model.FindingsResults indicated that perceived overqualification fully mediated the relationship between objective overqualification and job satisfaction. In addition, the relationship between objective overqualification and perceived overqualification was significant unless employees perceived high internal employment opportunities but low external employment opportunities at the same time. Same moderating pattern was also evident in the indirect effect of objective overqualification? Perceived overqualification? Job satisfaction.Research limitations/implicationsThis study has theoretical and practical implications for personnel management. Theoretically, this study contributed to the understanding of the relationship between objective overqualification and perceived overqualification. Practically, this study found that offering internal employment opportunities can mitigate the perception of overqualification when employees perceive limited external employment opportunities.Originality/valueThis is one of few studies that stressed the boundary conditions between objective overqualification and perceived overqualification under the framework of relative deprivation theory. In addition, this study provided time-lagged evidence of the relationship between objective overqualification, perceived overqualification and job satisfaction.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-11-2022-0771;The trickle-down effect of strengths use support: examining the linkage between support from superiors and support for subordinates. PurposeAlthough strengths use support (SUS) has been shown to facilitate employee strengths use and work engagement, little is known about how senior managers' SUS affects middle managers' SUS. The purpose of the present research was to examine the trickle-down effect of SUS from superiors on SUS for subordinates.Design/methodology/approachA two-wave questionnaire survey was conducted to collect data from middle managers (n = 228) at a global manufacturing firm in Japan.FindingsThe results of structural equation modeling indicated that (1) SUS from superiors indirectly promoted SUS for subordinates mediated through middle managers' strength use, and (2) SUS from superiors indirectly promoted SUS for subordinates mediated through middle managers' strength use, and subsequently through their work engagement.Research limitations/implicationsAs the respondents were middle-level managers at a manufacturing firm in Japan and were all Japanese nationals, indigenous culture and traditional work mentality may have affected the results.Practical implicationsTo create a supportive learning culture in an organization, human resource (HR) managers need to encourage senior-level managers to provide SUS for middle managers through HR systems such as training, appraisal, and survey feedback.Originality/valueThis study may be the first to clarify how SUS from superiors is linked to SUS for subordinates by identifying the mediating effects of strength use and work engagement, based on the Job-Demand Resources model, the Social Cognitive theory, and the trickle-down effect.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2023-0088;Work arrangement yo-yo: forced flexibility from the office to home and back again. PurposeThis study explored one form of remote working - work from home - to understand the impact of work disruptions on workers and human resource management (HRM) practice and therefore how to adapt to future crises. Specifically, the purpose is to understand the impact of events on employees when they are forced to move back and forth (yo-yoing) between work from home and a central office, using the case of Perth, Western Australia (WA).Design/methodology/approachThirty-nine interviews with leaders, managers and co-workers working in private and public organisations suggest that forced changes to work arrangements affect job content and demands, well-being and potentially career trajectories.FindingsThe authors critically applied and developed the tenets of event system theory (EST) (novelty, disruption and criticality) by analysing an ongoing or long event rather than a discrete or time-limited one. The study found that the work-from-home experience influenced the individual perception of whether remote working would suit employees in the future, potentially influencing career paths. In addition, the selection of locations to live, preferred properties (e.g. home office space) and access to services (e.g. broadband infrastructure) has also become dominant features of work decisions.Research limitations/implicationsWhile the study generated rich data, it is not without limitations. The participants were from one Australian state which may not reflect the COVID-19 experiences of other jurisdictions. In addition, the participants were mostly female so this may offer a different perspective than a more gender-balanced sample. The study was limited to the perspectives of employees and middle managers.Practical implicationsThe authors note three areas of implications for practitioners. First, the findings suggest that strong organisational and HRM support assists employees to cope well with change. Second, the importance of technological and social preparedness in improving employee experiences highlights the role of HRM in job design. Third, it is key that salient events are recognised as potential determinants of career pathways.Originality/valueThe evidence from this research broadens the application of EST showing that forced flexibility has an influence on work arrangements by influencing a series of changes in features of work and experiences of employees. As such, this impacts employee's well-being and potentially future career decisions.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2021-0131;Exploitative leadership and counterproductive work behavior: a discrete emotions approach. PurposeIntegrating appraisal theories of discrete emotions with the emotion regulation literature, this study aims to explore the relationships between exploitative leadership and certain types of counterproductive workplace behavior (CWB). Besides, this study seeks to examine the mediating roles of discrete emotions (i.e. anger and fear) and the moderating role of cognitive reappraisal within the proposed relationships.Design/methodology/approachBased on time-lagged survey data from 440 Chinese employees, this study conducted hierarchical regression analysis and bootstrapping approach to test the hypotheses.FindingsThe results revealed that exploitative leadership was positively related to approach-oriented CWB and avoidance-oriented CWB. In addition, this study found that anger mediated the relationship between exploitative leadership and approach-oriented CWB, whereas fear mediated the relationship between exploitative leadership and avoidance-oriented CWB. Further, cognitive reappraisal buffered the positive effects of exploitative leadership on anger and fear and the indirect effects of exploitative leadership on approach-oriented CWB (via anger) and avoidance-oriented CWB (via fear).Practical implicationsManagers should reduce leaders' exploitation and enhance employees' skills on emotional management and cognitive reappraisal.Originality/valueFirst, by verifying the effects of exploitative leadership on both approach-oriented and avoidance-oriented CWB, this study adds to the literature on exploitive leadership and provides a more complete understating of the relationship between exploitative leadership and workplace deviance. Second, this study enriches the understanding of the process through which exploitative leadership affects employees by demonstrating the novel mediating roles of discrete emotions (i.e. anger and fear) through the lens of appraisal theories of discrete emotions. Third, by verifying the moderating role of cognitive reappraisal, this study provides insights into the boundary conditions of the influences of exploitive leadership.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-12-2021-0909;Avoiding the burst pipeline post-COVID-19: drivers of female academic careers in Australia. Purpose Literature around the careers of female academics is targeted mainly toward identifying and examining career progression inhibitors, while the drivers appear largely unexplored. This paper aims to contribute to contemporary knowledge by identifying drivers to the career progression of female academics in Australia. With COVID-19 currently impacting the careers of female academics this knowledge can assist universities and human resource (HR) professionals in developing policies and practices to better facilitate female academic career progression. Design/methodology/approach Empirically this paper draws on a qualitative study of 18 male and 29 female academics, as well as nine senior university stakeholders. The authors employed semi-structured interviews and a novel methodology, Draw, Write, Reflect. Findings In line with attribution theory, senior stakeholders mainly identified organisational efforts, including leadership, gender equity endeavours, recruitment and promotion approaches, as well as a construct known as relative to opportunity considerations, as drivers of female academics' career progression. Female academics, however, largely attributed their career progression to personal factors, such as family support, informal mentoring, and determination and persistence. Practical implications The findings have implications for universities and HR practices seeking to facilitate female academic career progression. Implementation of the drivers identified may enhance female academics' abilities to progress their careers. Originality/value By focussing on the drivers of, rather than the barriers to, female academic careers, the research is novel in its identification of a previously unexplored mismatch between organisational attribution and individual attribution of career progression drivers thereby advancing knowledge of gender differences in academic careers.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2021-0259;Crafting telework: a process model of need satisfaction to foster telework outcomes. Purpose The purpose of this study is to offer a model explicating telework as a dynamic process, theorizing that teleworkers continuously adjust - their identities, boundaries and relationships - to meet their own needs for competence, autonomy and relatedness in their work and nonwork roles. Design/methodology/approach This study uses the lens of job crafting to posit changes teleworkers make to enhance work-nonwork balance and job performance, including time-related individual differences to account for contingencies in dynamic adjustments. Finally, this study discusses how feedback from work and nonwork role partners and one's self-evaluation results in an iterative process of learning to telework over time. Findings This model describes how teleworkers craft work and nonwork roles to satisfy needs, enhancing key outcomes and eliciting role partner feedback to further recraft telework. Research limitations/implications The propositions can be translated to hypotheses. As such the dynamic model for crafting telework can be used as a basis for empirical studies aimed at understanding how telework adjustment process unfolds. Practical implications Intervention studies could focus on teleworkers' job crafting behavior. Organizations may also offer training to prepare employees to telework and to create conditions under which teleworkers' job crafting behavior more easily translates into need satisfaction and positive outcomes. Social implications Many employees would prefer to work from home, at least partly, when the COVID-19 crisis is over. This model offers a way to facilitate a smooth transition into this work mode while ensuring work nonwork balance and performance. Originality/value Most telework research takes a static approach to focus on the work-family interface. This study proffers a dynamic approach suggesting need satisfaction as the mechanism enabling one to combine work and domestic roles and delineating how feedback enables continuous adjustment in professional and personal roles.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-09-2020-0669;Informal learning effort and attitude toward knowledge sharing in times of workplace conflict: curious case of joyous exploration and deprivation sensitivity. Purpose The study examined the impact of two dimensions of curiosity: joyous exploration (JE) and deprivation sensitivity (DSv) on informal learning effort (ILE) and attitude toward knowledge sharing (ATKS). The authors further explored the mediating effect of learning culture (LC) in the organization on the relationship of the two curiosity dimensions with ILE and ATKS. Additionally, the authors investigated the moderating effect of group dynamics in the form of intragroup task conflict (ITC) and relationship conflict (IRC) on the relationship of curiosity variables with LC, ILE and ATKS. Design/methodology/approach Survey instrument was distributed to 790 knowledge workers in various organizations through their HR managers. 403 responses were returned and used in the study. Findings JE, the self-determined manifestation of curiosity, impacts all elements of ILE and ATKS, while DSv influences a few aspects of ILE. The effect of JE on the dependent variables is, however, more substantial at low levels of ITC. ITC and IRC independently impact ILE, but only ITC moderates the relationships involving JE (but not DSv). LC emerges from JE (but not from DSv) and partially mediates its association with ILE and ATKS. Originality/value Through this work, we demonstrate the differential relevance of the curiosity dimensions and the intragroup conflict types - and their interaction effect - on learning effort and attitude toward knowledge sharing. The findings of the study open new avenues for interventions within the workplace learning and knowledge sharing domain.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2020-0305;Displacement-plurality (D-P) in women refugees, its influence on work engagement and implications for diversity practice: a critical and reflective review. Purpose Much of the current research on women refugees and work focuses solely on settlement, neglecting the effects of displacement within this equation, despite its significant impact. Drawing from the wider literature of international development, migration, gender, work psychology and sociology, this paper provides a framework to guide informed research within this area. Design/methodology/approach This paper is a reflective and critical review of the intersection between gender, forced displacement and work. It addresses a blind spot in the current work literature, which fails to address the impact of displacement on refugee women and the consequences of displacement for vocational engagement during resettlement. Findings This paper contributes to the current literature in four ways. First, it adds forced displacement to the peripheral-intersections literature informing Acker's theory of inequality regimes. Secondly, it contributes to a deeper understanding of how pluralities and intersectionality develop during forced displacement, by introducing the theory of displacement-plurality (D-P). Thirdly, it contributes to human resource management (HRM) diversity practice by explaining the relationship between D-P and related constructs, such as work engagement (WE), economic empowerment (EE), work-related factors (WRFs) and psycho-social factors (PSFs) to help improve localised diversity practices in relation to refugee populations. Fourthly, it provides a detailed framework to guide research and practice in this area, supported by a critical evaluation of the current refugee work literature. Originality/value When we understand displacement-related factors, we can move towards a more emancipatory approach to intersectionality, allowing us to develop more sophisticated approaches to diversity in organisations. In turn, this helps us to understand people's lived experiences and their responses to organisational interventions more effectively.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2020-0367;Navigating dual-careers: the challenge for professional couples. Purpose Dual-careers are an increasingly common typology among professionals yet very few studies have considered how two potentially competing career trajectories are managed in relation to the broader aspects of life, such as family and personal life. This article addresses the gap through an exploration of the strategies adopted by dual-career professional couples as they seek to navigate these challenges whilst satisfying individual and shared goals and aspirations. Design/methodology/approach Semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were carried out with 18 couples (dyads) from a range of professional occupations. Interviews were conducted individually, and then responses analysed and compared for key themes. Findings Rather than focusing on how couples manage work-life balance on a day-today basis this study shows how couples incorporate a more strategic approach to dual-careers so that both careers are able to progress, albeit within situational constraints. Practical implications To satisfy personal, business and economic performance goals, organisations and governments will need to find more creative ways to support employees as they seek to navigate careers while balancing the work and nonwork needs of themselves and their partner. The challenges faced by dual-career couples have implications for human resource managers as they seek to attract and retained talent within their organisations. Social implications Demographic and social changes at the household level will ultimately require changes at an organisational and broader societal level to meet the work and family needs of this growing cohort. Originality/value Rather than focusing on how couples manage work-life balance on a day-today basis this study shows how couples incorporate a more strategic approach to dual-careers so that both careers are able to progress, albeit within situational constraints.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2020-0406;Supervisor-directed OCB and deviant behaviors: the role of LMX and impression management motives. Purpose This study investigates the effect of supervisor-directed organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) on leader-member exchange (LMX), the moderating role of impression management motives on this relationship, the effect of LMX on organizational and interpersonal deviance and the mediating effect of LMX on the relationship between supervisor-directed OCB and deviant behaviors. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a survey questionnaire to collect data. Respondents were 342 nonmanagerial employees working in Surabaya Raya, Indonesia. Hypothesis testing is done using Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings The results show that supervisor-directed OCB is positively related to LMX, and LMX is negatively related to organizational deviance but not significantly related to interpersonal deviance. The study also finds that impression management motives moderate the positive relationship between supervisor-directed OCB and LMX. Furthermore, LMX mediates the relationship between supervisor-directed OCB and organizational deviance, but not interpersonal deviance. Practical implications This study suggests the importance of human resource management (HRM) activities and managers being aware of subordinate OCB motives and the impact of LMX on interpersonal and organizational deviance, as well as what supervisors need to do to reduce these negative effects. Originality/value Few studies examined the relationship between supervisor-directed OCB and workplace deviance behaviors (WDBs). This study provides a mechanism of their relationship by considering LMX as a mediator. Also, heretofore the existing studies tend to focus more on LMX as an antecedent of OCB. This study provides an understanding of OCB as an antecedent of LMX with the moderating effect of impression management motives.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2020-0449;Effects of person-organization fit objective feedback and subjective perception on organizational attractiveness in online recruitment. Purpose - This study applies a person-environment fit (PEF) framework to examine the extent to which organizational attractiveness may be influenced by person-organization fit (POF) feedback and person-job fit (PJF) feedback in web-based recruitment. Furthermore, the potential mediating roles of subjective POF and subjective PJF perceptions were examined.Design/methodology/approach - Senior undergraduate business administration students participated in a two-stage experiment by completing a paper-and-pencil survey during a campus career fair and then reviewing a recruitment website.Findings - Research findings showed that online assessment feedback on PJF was positively related to organizational attractiveness. The higher the level PJF, the more organizational attractiveness participants reported. Second, both POF and PJF feedback information can affect organizational attractiveness indirectly through subjective POF and PJF perceptions, respectively. Fresh graduates were more sensitive to PJF feedback in deciding organizational attractiveness.Originality/value - This study contributes to the recruitment literature in at least three ways. First, online recruitment messages concerning can affect organizational attractiveness. Second, in support of the PEF framework, fresh graduates can distinguish subjective POF perceptions from subjective PJF perceptions. Third, fresh graduates are more sensitive to PJF information and perceptions in deciding organizational attractiveness.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-08-2020-0609;Human resource practices, employee competencies and firm performance: a 2-1-2 multilevel mediational analysis. Purpose This study aims to understand the role of employee competencies in terms of the relationship between Human Resource Practices (HRPs) and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach A sample of 60 HR managers and 546 employees from large-scale food processing firms were considered for the study. The study presents a 2-1-2 multilevel mediational analysis in which HRPs and firm performance are measured at the firm level (Level-2) and employee competencies are measured at employee level (Level-1). Findings Positive relationship was found between HRPs and firm performance, which was partially mediated by employee competencies. Practical implications The study highlights the importance of employee-related factors by focusing on the wider dimensions of human capital (e.g. academic qualification, job experience) in HRPs-performance relationship. Originality/value The study undertakes a 2-1-2 multilevel mediational analysis, which is rarely applied in HRM studies;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2020-0453;Contexts of organizational learning in developing countries: the role of training programmes in Egyptian public banks. Purpose Little research into organizational learning in the public sector in developing countries' is known. In this paper, the authors investigated the context of organizational learning in the public banks in Egypt. Design/methodology/approach An ethnographic field research was employed by spending a month inside each of two public banks in Egypt. The ethnographic experience was operationalised by using direct observations of learning processes, procedures and practices, semi-structured interviews with learning specialists and focus group discussions with bankers. The authors used thematic analysis to determine the main themes in the previous data collection methods of ethnographic approach. Findings The findings confirmed a lack of clear focus for the organizational learning practices employed by the banks, which highlights issues of seriousness in undertaking and/or tackling organizational learning, and increased doubts in relation to the added value of the different forms of formal trainings bankers participate in. To enhance the culture and maintain effective functioning of formal organizational learning, the authors suggest considering the following three categories of barriers: purpose-related barriers, implementation and evaluation barriers. Originality/value Despite the generalisability caveats associated with the organizations studied, the authors believe that this paper contributes to the existing theory of organizational learning as it provides insights and understanding on the purpose, frame, conduct and results of organizational learning in the public sector. More specifically, the study is unique and is different from previous relevant studies as it relies on ethnographical approach in exploring how organizational leaning practices are perceived in public banks in developing countries.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2020-0007;How abusive supervision ultimately might enhance performance ratings among silent, neurotic employees. Purpose With a theoretical anchoring in the conservation of resources (COR) theory, this study investigates how employees' exposure to abusive supervision ultimately might lead to enhanced supervisor ratings of their job performance because employees react with defensive silence. Employees' neuroticism also might catalyze this process. Design/methodology/approach Multi-source, three-wave data were collected from employees and their supervisors in the power-distant, collectivistic country of Pakistan. Findings Beliefs about the presence of verbally abusive leaders, somewhat ironically, mitigate the risk of diminished supervisor-rated performance evaluations to the extent that those beliefs prompt employees to engage in self-protective behaviors to avoid confrontations with the abusive leaders. This mediating role of defensive silence is invigorated to the extent that employees' personalities make them more sensitive to stressful work situations. Practical implications For practitioners, this study identifies self-protective silence as a key, potentially worrisome mechanism that employees in power-distant, collectivistic countries may use to avoid negative performance ratings by leaders they perceive as abusive, and it reveals how this process tends to vary across different employees. Originality/value This research cites a critical, unexplored factor through which verbally abused employees can avoid negative performance evaluations, by engaging in defensive silence, not only as a potentially detrimental solution but also as an effective short-term solution. It further clarifies that this process is more likely to occur among neurotic employees.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-09-2019-0508;Keep your mouth shut until I feel good: testing the moderated mediation model of leader's threat to competence, self-defense tactics, and voice rejection. Purpose Although voice endorsement is essential for individuals, teams and organizational performance, leaders who consider followers' voice to be threatening are reluctant to implement followers' ideas. The authors, taking note of this phenomenon, investigate why leaders who feel a threat from followers' voice exhibit voice rejection at the workplace and when this detrimental tendency can be diminished. Thus, based on the self-defense tendency as per self-affirmation theory, the authors argue that those leaders who experience threat triggered by followers' voice, justify voice rejection through the self-defense tactics: message derogation and source derogation. In addition, the authors also propose that a leader's positive (negative) affect experienced before voice exposure may decrease (increase) self-defense and voice rejection. Design/methodology/approach To test the authors' moderated mediation model, they conducted two independent vignette studies (N = 269;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2019-0310;Insecurity and turnover as robots take charge: impact of neuroticism and change-related uncertainty. Purpose Data were collected using a survey questionnaire of 379 participants from business process outsourcing (BPO) organizations affected by robotic process automation (RPA). Structural equation modelling and hierarchical regression analysis were used to test the hypothesized relationships between the study variables. Design/methodology/approach The purpose of this paper is to develop and test a moderated-mediation model examining the relationships between uncertainty around changes due to RPA, neuroticism and job insecurity, and turnover intentions among BPO employees in India. Findings Uncertainty around RPA and neuroticism cause job insecurity among employees resulting in their intent to quit the organization. Further, the impact of job insecurity is influenced by employees' commitment to automation. Outlining the ways in which RPA-driven change impacts employees and organizations, our findings underscore the need for upskilling the affected employees besides developing coping mechanisms as a buffer to the negative impacts of large-scale automation-driven transformation in the industry under study. Originality/value Amidst the debate around the impact of RPA in developing countries, our research is the first attempt to systematically examine how RPA has led to concerns around job security leading to turnover intention among employees in the Indian BPO sector. It uniquely highlights the role of personality besides the issue of growing uncertainty due to RPA, requiring the immediate attention of organizations.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2020-0232;Cheating, culture and incentives: who deserves a bonus?. Purpose-The purpose of this research is to examine the relationship of perceptions of organizational justice on the ranking of candidates for incentive bonuses and the impact of organizational culture on these perceptions.Design/methodology/approach-A questionnaire was developed which asked respondents to rank a set of seven candidates for a sales bonus based on deservingness for the bonus. Descriptions of the candidates included information not only on whether they achieved a pre-established metric for the bonus, but on how they achieved (or failed to achieve) the metric. Hypotheses related compliance with norms of organizational justice, both by candidates and the organization, to candidate rank. The survey was administered to a sample of 204 employees of business organizations at all levels obtained through a survey research firm, as well as a sample of 52 employees of organizations in the Christian publishing industry. Nonparametric statistics were used to analyze the results. A comparison was made between the respondents sourced through the research firm, seen as representing the general population and those from the Christian-oriented group.Findings- Hypotheses that respondents will seek to punish violators of justice norms, reward compliers and compensate victims of organizational unfairness were generally supported. More interesting were differences between the groups of respondents from the general population and the group representing Christian-based firms.Originality/value-This article reveals the impact of organizational culture on the acceptance of incentive systems. The research employed a practitioner survey, rather than more common experimental approach.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22198;Effects of formal mentoring support on newcomer-protege affective organizational commitment: a self-concept-based perspective. The study proposes and tests a self-concept-based perspective for the effects of formal mentoring support on affective organizational commitment (AOC) via multiple mediators. Using time-lagged multi-source dyadic data (n = 203), we demonstrate that formal mentoring support significantly influences newcomer-proteges' AOC through an underlying self-evaluative mechanism indicated by organization-based self-esteem (OBSE), even in the presence of a well-established alternative mediator (perceived organizational support;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22152;A relational perspective on supervisor-initiated turnover: Implications for human resource management based on a multi-method investigation of leader-member exchange relationships. Despite the great emphasis organizations and human resource management (HRM) research place on turnover issues, one turnover phenomenon has received only limited attention so far: joint leader-member turnover. This research examines supervisor-initiated turnover (SIT) (i.e., employees' decision to quit their employer to follow a former supervisor to a new organization) and develops a comprehensive model of the SIT decision process, grounded on conservation of resources (COR) theory, that delineates the resource evaluation, conservation and investment deliberations of employees. We take a relational perspective and particularly focus on the leader-member relationship as an important antecedent of SIT and thereby respond to the call for more critical investigations of leader-member exchange (LMX) and corresponding HRM implications. Our three studies (survey, scenario experiment, and dyadic interview study) demonstrate that LMX positively affects SIT intentions (SITI) and that supervisor commitment represents an important mediating mechanism of the LMX-SITI relationship. Our interview study with 46 leader-member dyads identifies relational factors that promote or hinder SIT beyond the leader-member relationship. We discuss the theoretical contributions and practical implications for HRM.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22120;Dynamism and realignment in the HR architecture: Online labor platform ecosystems and the key role of contractors. Given the widespread contribution of independent contractors to organizational innovation and competitive advantage, it is timely to reassess assumptions about the HRM practices appropriate to their management and the rationale for organizations to work with them. In the original and highly influential HR architecture model of Lepak and Snell (1999), contractor status is viewed as an outcome of the low value and/or low uniqueness of human capital resulting in the proposition to externalize and manage them using either none or minimal compliance-based HRM practices. Developments in digital technologies and algorithmic management epitomized by online labor platforms prompt us to reconsider these assumptions and to challenge the proposed links between value/uniqueness of human capital, employment mode and HRM practices that are assumed by the HR architecture model. Using insights from online labor platforms, we argue that the significant benefits to firms of working with contractors, coupled with the possibilities offered by algorithmic management to efficiently monitor and regulate their behavior, provide a compelling reason for organizations to choose external employment modes even when workers are key to value creation. We challenge the alignment and stability of the relationships proposed by the HR architecture model, and offer propositions to extend the model by reconsidering the rationale for, and nature of, HRM practices associated with contractors. This reassessment is both timely and relevant given the growing prominence of business models where externalizing workers is central alongside the development of new forms of algorithmic human resource management to control them.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22112;Emphasizing me or we: Training framing and self-concept in network-based leadership development. This study explores how the motivational framing of a network training program may positively or (inadvertently) adversely impact participants' discomfort with strategic networking and motivation to network. We examine the impact of a me-focused framing (i.e., on the personal career benefits that individuals can accrue through strategic networking) and a we-focused framing (i.e., on the benefits to the team/organization of individuals' strategic networking) compared to a control group in two field-based quasi-experiments. In both studies, we found no difference between the two training frames in their effect on the two training outcomes when looking at participants' reactions, on average. However, in the second study, we find that individual differences in the way participants relate to others (i.e., the extent to which they endorse an individual or a collective self-concept) change the impact of the framing on their discomfort with and motivation to network. The findings highlight the importance of considering the match or mismatch between training framing and self-concept. In the we-focused condition, a match was related to decreased networking discomfort, while a mismatch was related to increased discomfort and decreased motivation. In the me-focused condition, a mismatch was counter-intuitively related to decreased discomfort. These findings suggest that considering participants' reactions to training (i.e., change in discomfort and motivation), on average, may mask important differences in their response to network-based training and that tailoring network training to participants' self-concepts may be an important consideration for human resource management professionals.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22078;Exploring the pandemic's potential effects on workers' collectivist values, prosocial behaviors, and attitudes toward mistreatment. The global COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed the way we live and work in the short-term, but history suggests that the crisis may also exert deeper, longer-lasting effects. With the aim of providing preliminary insight into this possibility, we theoretically construct and empirically test hypotheses for how exposure to COVID-19 stimuli (e.g., reading or watching media coverage, observing relief efforts) relates to the deep-seated values that guide workers' attitudes and behaviors. Specifically, we build from prior work to posit that exposure to COVID-19 stimuli is positively associated with workers' self-transcendent prosocial values, which motivate prosocial behaviors directed toward society as a whole (i.e., charitable donations) and coworkers (i.e., helping). Extend the extant literature, we further argue that exposure to COVID-19 stimuli will be positively associated with conservation values emphasizing self-restraint, submission, protection of order, and harmony in relations, which in turn influences workers' willingness to tolerate mistreatment by authorities (i.e., abusive supervision, authoritarian leadership, exploitation). Evidence from 2,929 full-time Chinese employees tracked for nearly 2 months and a diverse sample of 310 workers in the United States generally support our arguments, but also provide insight into potential cultural nuances.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22076;The effects of negative mentoring experiences on mentor creativity: The roles of mentor ego depletion and traditionality. The literature often focuses on the positive effects of mentoring, especially for proteges. When mentoring experiences are negative, the assumption is that these negative effects are less detrimental to the mentor than to the protege, owing to the mentor's greater relative power in the relationship. This study uses ego depletion theory to examine the link between negative mentoring experiences (as rated by proteges) and mentor creativity and focuses on the mediating and moderating roles of mentor ego depletion and mentor traditionality on this link. The results are based on data from 227 proteges, 187 mentors, and 187 supervisors of mentors in Chinese organizations. The findings support a mediating effect of ego depletion on the negative relationship between negative mentoring experiences and mentor creativity. In addition, the study finds that traditionality attenuates both the positive relationship between negative mentoring experiences and ego depletion and the indirect effect of negative mentoring experiences on mentors' creativity through ego depletion. The implications for management theory and practice are discussed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2024-0090;Skilled migrant hiring and selection: organisations' challenges in embracing diversity in recruitment. Purpose-This paper used Zikic's (2015) integrated framework for managing diversity to review the skilled migrant literature and explore reasons non-English-speaking background (NESB) skilled migrants (SMs) are disadvantaged in the host country recruitment market. This research examines organisations' role in attracting and facilitating the entry of NESB SMs to their organisations and embracing diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Design/methodology/approach-The authors conducted a systematic literature review following the integrated framework combining the intelligent career theory and the resource-based view. This framework allows the exploration of the challenges NESB SMs face with their career capital in the host country concerning the people management systems and processes organisations often use in recruitment. Findings-This review revealed multiple challenges NESB SMs face when negotiating their workplace transition in the host country destinations. The study shows that the underutilisation and underemployment among NESB SMs are partly caused by these SMs' foreign experiences but mainly by the host countries' NESB SM-unfriendly recruitment practices. It also uncovers gaps between macro, meso and micro levels in SM recruitment. Research limitations/implications-A limitation inherent in a systematic literature review is that the effectiveness of the search is contingent upon the quality of the search strings used. Second, the core themes in the synthesis were identified following Zikic's (2015) integrated framework and focused only on individual/micro factors of SMs and meso/organisational factors. Many other structural and contextual factors were not included in the review. This review is also limited to NESB SMs' recruitment. Nonetheless, this process helps us achieve the core aim set for this review, to explore the reasons behind the hardships NESB SMs face when searching for ways to enter the host professional job market and the role of organisations in attracting and facilitating NESB SMs' labour market entry. Originality/value-This research connected NESB SMs' micro-level difficulties to the meso layer of organisations' HRM policies. This review clarified the role of organisational strategic HRM in attracting and welcoming NESB SMs into their organisation before leveraging their career diversity. The findings from the review also assisted in extending Zikic's (2015) integrated framework.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-07-2023-0618;Keeping silent or playing good citizen? Differential mechanisms of negative workplace gossip on targets reactions. PurposeBased on the Sociometer Theory, this study aims to develop a comprehensive framework explaining how and when negative workplace gossip triggers distinct responses, including employee silence and compulsory citizenship behavior (CCB).Design/methodology/approachTwo scenario-based experiments and a field survey were conducted to examine hypotheses. Study 1 (N = 149) manipulated workplace negative gossip and assessed the mediating effects of state self-esteem. Study 2 (N = 217) manipulated workplace negative gossip and consideration of future consequences (CFC) to verify the stability of the mediating mechanism and test the moderating effect of CFC. Study 3 (N = 321) tested the whole research model.FindingsThe findings indicate that negative workplace gossip decreases state self-esteem, resulting in silence among employees with low levels of CFC, while inducing CCB through state self-esteem among employees with high levels of CFC.Originality/valueThis study not only extends the research of negative workplace gossip by exploring its multifaceted impact on employee responses but also highlights the role of personality traits in shaping individuals' response strategies.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-03-2023-0192;Advancing a theoretical framework for exploring heuristics and biases within HR decision-making contexts. PurposeThis paper aims to provide an elucidative and explanatory overview of decision-making theory that human resource management and development (HR) researchers and practitioners can use to explore the impact of heuristics and biases on organizational decisions, particularly within HR contexts.Design/methodology/approachThis paper draws upon three theoretical resources anchored in decision-making research: the theory of bounded rationality, the heuristics and biases program, and cognitive-experiential self-theory (CEST). A selective narrative review approach was adopted to identify, translate, and contextualize research findings that provide immense applicability, connection, and significance to the field and study of HR.FindingsThe authors extract key insights from the theoretical resources surveyed and illustrate the linkages between HR and decision-making research, presenting a theoretical framework to guide future research endeavors.Practical implicationsDecades of decision-making research have been distilled into a digestible and accessible framework that offers both theoretical and practical implications.Originality/valueHeuristics are mental shortcuts that facilitate quick decisions by simplifying complexity and reducing effort needed to solve problems. Heuristic strategies can yield favorable outcomes, especially amid time and information constraints. However, heuristics can also introduce systematic judgment errors known as biases. Biases are pervasive within organizational settings and can lead to disastrous decisions. This paper provides HR scholars and professionals with a balanced, nuanced, and integrative framework to better understand heuristics and biases and explore their organizational impact. To that end, a forward-looking and direction-setting research agenda is presented.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2023-0358;Addressing the gap in information security: an HR-centric and AI-driven framework for mitigating insider threats. Purpose - Despite ongoing reports of insider-driven leakage of confidential data, both academic scholars and practitioners tend to focus on external threats and favour information technology (IT)-centric solutions to secure and strengthen their information security ecosystem. Unfortunately, they pay little attention to human resource management (HRM) solutions. This paper aims to address this gap and proposes an actionable human resource (HR)-centric and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven framework. Design/methodology/approach - The paper highlights the dangers posed by insider threats and presents key findings from a Leximancer-based analysis of a rapid literature review on the role, nature and contribution of HRM for information security, especially in addressing insider threats. The study also discusses the limitations of these solutions and proposes an HR-in-the-loop model, driven by AI and machine learning to mitigate these limitations. Findings - The paper argues that AI promises to offer many HRM-centric opportunities to fortify the information security architecture if used strategically and intelligently. The HR-in-the-loop model can ensure that the human factors are considered when designing information security solutions. By combining AI and machine learning with human expertise, this model can provide an effective and comprehensive approach to addressing insider threats. Originality/value - The paper fills the research gap on the critical role of HR in securing and strengthening information security. It makes further contribution in identifying the limitations of HRM solutions in info security and how AI and machine learning can be leveraged to address these limitations to some extent.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2023-0099;Work engagement and the impact of a social identity crafting approach to leadership: a case from Africa's air transport industry. PurposeManagers of public organizations in liberalized sectors face the dual imperative of retaining skilled employees who might be poached by commercial competitors and improving service performance levels without a free hand to invest resources. While employee work engagement (EWE) has been previously suggested as a solution to such management challenges, limitations in its ability to retain employees have been identified. We therefore examine how a social identity crafting (SIC) approach to public leadership that confers a sense of group identity among team members can enhance and extend beyond EWE in addressing this dual imperative.Design/methodology/approachWe report findings from a survey of employees (n = 199) at ATCO, a state-owned national airline that is facing challenges from commercial rivals within a new, competitive environment.FindingsWe confirm previously identified limitations of EWE and, further, demonstrate that a social identity approach to leadership offers a promising avenue for public managers, not only by enhancing employee engagement but, more importantly, by enhancing retention and service performance.Originality/valueWe contribute to studies of leadership, particularly for managers operating in the public sector and resource-constrained environments, demonstrating how SIC, which does not require costly investment to attain, can deliver improved service performance and reduced employee turnover intention, operating beyond EWE, which reaches a plateau in respect of the latter.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-12-2021-0867;Dissecting HR's role in disaster preparedness and response: a phenomenological approach. PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to examine the role of human resources (HR) leaders in disaster preparedness and response efforts of organizations. The study used Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory as anchor and was conducted in the Philippines - a country that regularly experiences disruptions due to disasters.Design/methodology/approachThe study utilized a phenomenological approach in gathering and analyzing data from semi-structured interviews with 16 HR leaders. They hold either an executive or managerial position and belong to organizations situated in areas that have experienced disasters within the past two years. The areas are likewise prone to further experience of disasters such as flooding, earthquake and volcanic eruption as identified by international disaster watch organizations.FindingsResults surfaced three superordinate themes that reflect the role of HR in disaster situations - (1) contributor to the business continuity plan formulation and implementation;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2022-0090;How transformational leaders get employees to take initiative and display creativity: the catalytic role of work overload. PurposeThis study investigates the mediating role of personal initiative taking in the link between employees' exposure to transformational leadership and their engagement in creative behavior, as well as a potential catalytic role of perceived work overload in this process.Design/methodology/approachThe research hypotheses were tested with survey data collected among employees of a large organization that operates in the telecommunications sector.FindingsTransformational leadership translates into enhanced creative work efforts among employees, because these employees adopt an action-based approach toward work. This mediating role of personal initiative taking is particularly prominent among employees who encounter excessive workloads in their daily jobs, because their initiative and creativity promise solutions to this resource-draining work situation.Practical implicationsFor human resource managers, this study reveals that employees who go out of their way to address problem situations offer an important means by which a leadership style that inspires and challenges followers can be leveraged to produce enhanced creative outcomes. It also pinpoints how this process can be triggered by employees' beliefs that work demands are excessive.Originality/valueThis study adds to prior research by detailing a hitherto overlooked factor (personal initiative) and catalyst (perceived work overload), related to the translation of transformational leadership into increased creative behavior.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2022-0085;AMO model for neuro-inclusive remote workplace. Purpose - The aim of this article is to extend current debates on organizational equality, diversity and inclusion to a consideration of neurodivergence in the remote workplace context.Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on the ability, motivation, and opportunity (AMO) model and an emerging strength-based approach to neurodiversity, this conceptual paper integrates research on neurodiversity at work and remote working to provide a novel AMO model for a neuro-inclusive remote workplace.Findings - Through a theoretically informed discussion of barriers to effective remote work from the perspective of neurominorities, the AMO model for the neuro-inclusive remote workplace is offered to assist organizations in creating an inclusive remote work environment where both neurominorities and neurotypicals can equally contribute to organizational success. Specific examples of how certain barriers to effective remote work can be mitigated are outlined and explained.Practical implications - The conceptual model presented in this paper can assist HR practitioners in developing a comprehensive approach to skill, motivation, and opportunity-enhancing practices that are tailored to the unique needs of neurominorities in a specific context of remote work to generate mutual gains.Originality/value - The model of interactions between individual and system factors offered enables a better theoretical understanding of the conditions under which high performance of neurodivergent individuals could be achieved with an associated positive impact on their well-being. The paper contributes to recent calls for more equitable and empathetic approaches to investing in employees with different cognitive profiles and does so in the underexplored context of remote work.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-11-2021-0799;Narcissists going above and beyond? The role of perceived negative inequity and self-enhancement motivation. Purpose Utilizing a self-regulatory perspective, the authors examine how narcissism influences perceived negative inequity and the downstream effects on self-enhancement motivation and organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) over time. Design/methodology/approach A total of 689 useable three-wave panel data were obtained via Amazon Mechanical Turk during a three-month period. A latent growth curve modeling approach using EQS 6.4 for Windows was employed to test the hypothesized model. Findings Results illustrate that individuals with higher levels of narcissism perceive higher levels of perceived negative inequity and then form higher levels of self-enhancement motivation, which prompt more OCB directed toward the organization (OCBO) than OCB directed toward individuals (OCBI). When perceived negative inequity increases over time, narcissists experience a faster increase in self-enhancement motivation, which also leads to a faster increase in OCBO compared to the increase in OCBI. Originality/value Theoretically, this study provides theoretical and empirical insights into understanding the process through which narcissists' OCBs are motivated. Practically, this study offers several practical recommendations that help managers manage OCBs effectively in the organization.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-08-2019-0427;Retention and turnover of staff undertaking degree studies: insights and evidence from South Africa. Purpose Social exchange theory predicts that perceptions of employee/employer exchange relationships may change as employees add educational qualifications. Literature also suggests that more innovative individuals, who are particularly important to organisations, may be more likely to change jobs. The purpose of this study is to test how the innovativeness of an individual differs in its contribution to retention when subjected to different mediating and moderating influences indicated in the literature, for a cohort of employees that are undertaking degree studies while working. Design/methodology/approach To test theory that suggests certain implications for employee turnover, the part-time studies unit of a large South African university offering degree studies by evening classes was sampled, yielding 323 useable responses, with a response rate of about 30%. Structural equation modelling (SEM) is used to test a theoretical model predicting certain mediating and moderating influences on the relationship between individual innovativeness and turnover intentions. Findings Individuals with higher innovativeness self-report higher turnover intentions, which seem to be reduced by the mediating effects of perceived supervisor support and job satisfaction. Perceptions of distributive justice and core self-evaluations, which may be associated with an individual's evaluation of the social exchange relationship, are found to directly enable retention. Originality/value A model of moderation and mediation relationships between employee innovativeness and turnover intentions is derived from the literature and tested, offering novel insights into how to retain valuable staff in this context.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-07-2021-0495;Job crafting, meaningfulness and affective commitment by gig workers towards crowdsourcing platforms. Purpose Through focusing on gig workers registered in three crowdsourcing platforms, the authors investigate how individual and collaborative job crafting may be positively related to the meaningful work and affective commitment those gig workers develop towards the crowdsourcing platforms they register in. Design/methodology/approach The authors employed a quantitative research method in which they focused on date from surveys completed by 327 gig workers. They tested the hypotheses using SmartPLS 3, which is more suitable when dealing with complex models, non-normal data, small samples and higher-order constructs. Findings The results showed that the proactive behaviour embedded within both individual and collaborative job crafting may lead to a sense of meaningfulness for gig workers and subsequently, their affective commitment towards the crowdsourcing platforms they register in. Specifically, the more gig workers undertake individual (H1) and collaborative (H2) job crafting behaviour, the greater the sense of meaningfulness they develop. Moreover, meaningfulness for gig workers positively affects their affective commitment towards the crowdsourcing platforms they register with (H3). Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first of its kind in the context of France and the European Union to focus on job crafting and its effect on both meaningful work and the affective commitment of non-traditional workers. This paper contributes by filling a gap in human resource (HR) management, in which empirical studies that address gig work have been limited so far.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Purpose Although common throughout the world, little is known about the mechanism by which nepotism is associated with employee outcomes. Drawing from social exchange theory, this study examines whether fear-based silence mediates the relationship between nepotism with employee workplace withdrawal and career satisfaction. In addition, whether gender moderates the relationship between nepotism and fear-based silence is also examined. Design/methodology/approach Two time-lagged surveys of 330 employees in the Indian banking sector were completed. Findings As hypothesized, nepotism was positively related to fear-based silence and employee workplace withdrawal;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-09-2020-0663;It's the work climate that keeps me here: the interplay between the HRM process and emergent factors in the construction of employee experiences. Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the interplay between human resource management (HRM) and emergent factors in constructing a strong HRM climate. Specifically, the paper aims to shed light on how employee perceptions of the HRM process and emergent factors together construct a strong HRM climate, i.e. employees' shared perceptions of HRM. Design/methodology/approach The paper uses qualitative interview data (managers and employees) from two organisations operating in Finland. The data are analysed based on a systematic data analysis and gives an illustration of the interplay between high-performance work system and the emergent factors. Findings The findings illustrate the three types of interplay between HPWS and emergent factors - supplementation, substitution and suffocation - that construct employee experience. Originality/value The paper extends earlier discussions on the relationship between HRM and employee experience by empirically examining how the HRM process - together with emergent factors - constructs a strong HRM climate. The present study contributes to further theorising and increasing our understanding of the creation of employee experience.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-08-2020-0617;How do high-performance work systems affect innovation performance? The organizational learning perspective. Purpose Achieving organizational-level outcomes through human resource practices (HRP) as the basis of nearly all organizational improvements has remained relatively unexplored, which requires more investigations. Therefore, the present study aimed to develop a framework to theorize how high-performance work systems (HPWS) can provide organizations with critical instruments for organizational learning (OL) creation that in turn leads to innovation performance (IP). Design/methodology/approach Survey-based, multisource research was designed to examine the proposed model, using the data collected from 154 pharmaceutical industry-related companies. Findings According to the study results, HPWS concentrating on enhancing practices of abilities, motivations and opportunities (AMO) were positively associated with OL, which could in turn improve IP. Moreover, innovation culture (IC) showed a significant moderating effect on the association between OL and IP. Originality/value The central originality of this research first is that HPWS acts as antecedents of OL capabilities contributing to firm-level IP;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2020-0303;Cross-border and sedentary workers' job satisfaction. Purpose This study aims to explore cross-border and sedentary workers' job satisfaction, analyzing the role played by employability dimensions (occupational expertise, anticipation/optimization and personal flexibility), a job resource (autonomy) and job demands (job insecurity and toxic leadership), using the job demands-resources (JD-R) model as a theoretical framework. Moreover, this study tried to detect possible discrepancies between the two subsamples. Design/methodology/approach The study involved a sample of 250 employees, 40% of whom were frontier workers. Data were collected with a self-report questionnaire and analyzed with SPSS 25. A hierarchical regression analysis and t-test for independent samples were performed. Findings The findings evidenced differences between the two subsamples concerning the job satisfaction predictors. Specifically, for cross-border workers, optimization/anticipation appeared significantly positively related to job satisfaction. For sedentary workers, toxic leadership and job insecurity were significantly negatively related to job satisfaction. Autonomy was positively related to the outcome for both samples. Furthermore, cross-border workers reported a higher level of optimization/anticipation, personal flexibility and job satisfaction than sedentary workers. Originality/value This paper contributed to fill a gap currently present in the literature on the cross-border population, with a specific focus on job satisfaction. This study confirmed the existence of peculiar working dynamics for cross-border workers.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-11-2019-0619;Empowering leadership: balancing self-determination and accountability for motivation. Purpose This study set out to investigate the role of self-determination and accountability in the relationship between empowering leadership, motivation and performance. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 172 participants working in an international software development organization. Hypotheses were tested in PROCESS using the Preacher and Hayes (2008) bootstrapping method. Findings Results indicate that empowering leadership played a significant role satisfying basic psychological needs. As expected, the satisfaction of needs is related to autonomous motivation. Crucially, perceived accountability was also positively related to autonomous motivation. Research limitations/implications The cross-sectional design of this study limits the ability to rule out the possibility of reverse causation. Practical implications The results suggest that traditional management practices such as accountability can be successfully utilized in conjunction with self-determination theory without undermining autonomous motivation. This study highlights two key opportunities for human resources (HR) professionals. Specifically, by equipping managers with the skills to display empowering leadership behaviors, and by communicating organizational values and individual job meaning to enhance identified forms of motivation, HR can fully realize the benefits of autonomous employee motivation. Originality/value This paper offers valuable insight into how leaders can balance the satisfaction of basic psychological needs with accountability to influence autonomous motivation in employees. The model presented demonstrates the potential of empowering leadership in achieving this balance and highlights the importance of identified motivation as a powerful correlate of work performance.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2019-0547;Curvilinear effects of work engagement on job outcomes. Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the non-linear effects of work engagement (WE) on the job outcomes' creative performance (CRP), extra-role customer service (ERCS) and turnover intention (TI). Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 405 millennial frontline employees (FLEs) working in the hospitality industry in Kenya. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the hypothesized relationships. Findings The results yielded support for one relationship. WE was found to have a significant non-linear relationship with TI. This finding provides evidence of a ceiling to the positive impact of WE on reduced TI. WE and CRP and ERCS were however found to be non-significant and linear, and significant and linear, respectively. Research limitations/implications A large number of studies have evidenced positive individual and organizational outcomes associated with WE. This study however, is important, as the dark side of WE is empirically examined, therefore providing a different perspective of the concept. Practical implications The study findings affirm that management must exercise caution with excess levels of WE among millennial FLEs as this may lead to unfavourable outcomes. Originality/value In this research, the assumption of linearity is challenged. Empirical evidence for the need to systematically explore non-linear associations for a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between variables is provided. Moreover, this study is among the few in which the presence of curvilinear relations between WE and job outcomes is examined in a non-Western context.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22266;Thriving for Nothing? The Hidden Costs of Thriving for Employees With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Their Employers. Research has shown that thriving at work leads to positive outcomes for both organizations and employees. A critical element of thriving is self-regulation, which enables employees to effectively manage their emotions and behaviors in alignment with their long-term goals. However, there is a limited understanding of how employees experience thriving when self-regulation is impaired. In this article, we integrate thriving theory and one of its central elements, self-regulation, with research on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) which has shown that the condition is associated with reduced and sometimes severely impaired self-regulation. Empirically, we explore how employees with ADHD experience thriving at work using a qualitative study of working individuals. In contrast to previous findings, our study uncovers a dark side of thriving for employees with ADHD, with negative consequences for their wellbeing and growth opportunities, and ultimately an increased likelihood of voluntary quitting. In our analysis, we explain why, despite an initial positive boost in productivity, thriving ends up being a harmful process for employees with ADHD. We argue that low self-regulation, together with low self-esteem and fear of failure, drive them to work excessively and neglect caring for themselves and their families. We develop recommendations for employees with ADHD and their companies to stop this negative downward spiral.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22262;It Matters How You Got There and Who Else Is Doing It: Examining the Effects of Two Social-Contextual Characteristics of Working From Home. Drawing on self-determination theory, this study advances our understanding of employees' experiences working from home (WFH). Specifically, we examine the effects of two social-contextual characteristics of WFH arrangements: whether employees voluntarily initiate their arrangement (WFH initiation) and the proportion of WFH employees in a unit (WFH density). We conducted multilevel analyses on a multisource dataset drawn from organizational HR records and two surveys of 2115 WFH employees in a Fortune 500 organization. Employees who voluntarily initiated WFH, rather than at their employer's direction, experienced higher job autonomy and lower isolation. WFH employees in units with a lower proportion of other WFH employees experienced higher job autonomy. WFH initiation and WFH density also had effects on several distal employee outcomes, including job satisfaction, organizational knowledge, and turnover intentions, through their effects on job autonomy and isolation. Our findings provide valuable insight into the experiences of WFH employees and call attention to two important, yet understudied, factors that shape these experiences.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22200;The SMART model of work design: A higher order structure to help see the wood from the trees. We propose a new work design model, SMART work design, that identifies five higher order categories of work characteristics, including stimulating work characteristics (task variety, skill variety, information processing requirements, and problem-solving requirements), mastery work characteristics (job feedback, feedback from others, and role clarity), autonomous work characteristics (decision-making autonomy, timing autonomy, and method autonomy), relational work characteristics (social support, task significance, and beneficiary contact), and tolerable work characteristics (low levels of: role overload, work-home conflict, and role conflict). Higher order confirmatory factor analysis of working participants provided initial evidence of this structure (Study 1, N = 1107), which was replicated in an additional dataset (Study 2, time 1, N = 709). To provide further evidence, we examined Study 2 data across three waves (N = 573) to show that each higher order factor at time 1 predicted time 3 job satisfaction either directly or via the theorized time 2 mediators (challenge appraisals, work meaningfulness, fulfillment of relatedness needs, and activated negative affect). In Study 3 (N = 108), employees' scores on specific higher order variables correlated with leader ratings of performance in the expected ways. The SMART work design model provides a unique integrating and multidimensional theory of work design that extends beyond existing models. The model can be used to facilitate the synthesis of research knowledge and guide scholars and practitioners to diagnose and address contemporary work design challenges.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22164;When firms adopt sustainable human resource management: A fuzzy-set analysis. Sustainable human resource management (HRM) is critical to sustainable corporate development. However, there is little systematic research examining the determinants of sustainable HRM adoption. We fill this void by identifying and introducing a configurational approach to examine when firms adopt sustainable HRM. Based on institutional theory, we develop a typology of institutional contexts associated with sustainable HRM adoption. We posit that institutional conditions in configuration facilitate firms' adoption of sustainable HRM. Thus, we hypothesize a primary institutional configuration where institutional support, institutional quality, and institutional infrastructure combine to promote the adoption of sustainable HRM. We further propose alternative types of configurations conducive to the adoption of sustainable HRM by introducing two organizational conditions: strategic leadership support and resource slack. A fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis on data from 57 cases in China supports our hypotheses. We find that the combination of institutional conditions promotes the adoption of highly sustainable HRM, and the two alternative types provide functional substitutes for the primary type: (a) strategic leadership support substitutes for the combination of institutional support and institutional infrastructure, and (b) resource slack substitutes for institutional infrastructure. We build an institutional configurational model to advance a holistic understanding of the theoretical drivers of sustainable HRM, contributing to the research on sustainable HRM, institutional theory, leadership, and resource slack.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1002/hrm.22159;Gender diversity advantage at middle management: Implications for high performance work system improvement and organizational performance. Research on women in leadership positions has largely focused on the board or top management team (TMT) leadership level, showing that increased female representation at these levels can benefit organizational performance. However, the strategic implications of female representation at middle management have been largely neglected. The current study addresses this issue in relation to High Performance Work System (HPWS) improvement and organizational performance (profitability). By analyzing the multi-wave (2009, 2011, and 2013) Workplace Panel Survey (WPS) data collected from 1101 organizations in South Korea, we found a gender diversity advantage at middle management;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

10.1108/PR-11-2023-0957;Labor market institutions and employee self-reported mental health. PurposeThe study draws on emerging research on declining employee mental health, particularly employees with low educational attainment, in human resource management (HRM) and health and tests whether labor market institutions are empirically associated with better mental health among workers from different educational backgrounds.Design/methodology/approachThis study draws on a large national sample of part- and full-time workers and models a conditional relationship between labor market institutions and employee self-rated mental health using ordinary least squares (OLS) models with fixed effects.FindingsThe findings indicate membership in a labor market institution such as a union is positively associated with improved employee mental health, but the relationship is moderated by educational attainment. Union membership is associated with better mental health among employees with low educational attainment and appears to bring these workers up to a level of mental health that is comparable to more highly educated workers, thereby reducing mental health inequality. However, union membership has no effect on the mental health of more highly educated employees.Originality/valueDespite the recognition that declining worker mental health presents challenges for workers, organizations and society, systematic empirical research on institutional mechanisms that may affect mental health is limited. This study draws on data of part- and full-time workers to model the relationship with a sample large enough to specify conditional models to account for heterogeneous relationships conditional on workers' educational attainment. The findings have important implications for our understanding of employee mental health, employment relations and institutional mechanisms to help workers and improve organizational performance.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-02-2022-0078;Fostering public sector employees' citizen-oriented boundary-spanning behaviors through human resource flexibility and employee perceptions of normative public values. Purpose Public sector employees' contributions play a crucial role in improving public service quality and promoting the image of public organizations. The aim of this research is to unravel how and when human resource (HR) flexibility activates citizen-oriented boundary-spanning behaviors among public sector employees.Design/methodology/approach The data were collected from 427 public sector employees and 102 supervisors working for governmental agencies from the districts of a major city in Vietnam. Multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) was employed to analyze the data.Findings The positive associations between HR flexibility and the three dimensions of citizen-oriented boundary-spanning behaviors were supported. Harmonious passion demonstrated a mediating path for such linkages. Employee perceptions of normative public values were found to exert a positive moderating effect on the positive link between HR flexibility and harmonious passion, as well as their indirect link via harmonious passion.Originality/value This study advances the literature by identifying how and when HR flexibility shapes citizen-oriented boundary-spanning behaviors among public sector employees.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-08-2021-0593;Trust networks, compassionate helping and employee performance. PurposeAlthough extant research on trust focuses on the dyadic relationship (trustor-trustee), the effectiveness of an employee's outcome may vary depending on the features of trust networks. This study examined how an employee's centrality in two types of trust networks (cognitive and affective) among coworkers is associated with employee job performance. Further, this study highlighted the mediating role of compassionate help in the effect of affective trust networks on individual performance.Design/methodology/approachSurvey data were collected from 204 employees and 39 team leaders in South Korea. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling.FindingsThe results indicated that cognitive trust centrality is positively associated with employee job performance, but affective trust centrality is not. However, an affective trust centrality indirectly increases individual performance via compassionate helping from coworkers.Originality/valueThis study contributes to a better understanding of trust networks and compassionate helping and expands both trust literature and HQR research.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2021-0719;Creating resource passageways in cross-cultural virtual work teams: a longitudinal field study. PurposeLens of conservation of resources (COR) theory has been used to study how organizations can create resource passageways for their employees via managers. This has been examined in cross-cultural virtual work teams distributed across time and space within the high-resource loss context of the COVID-19 pandemic.Design/methodology/approachLongitudinal field design was used in a transnational organization involving data collection at three times over eight months. At Time 1, qualitative methodology was used to propose a conceptual model. At Time 2 and Time 3, an online survey was used to collect data for 205 virtual work teams across 10 countries in the Asia-Pacific region pre and post manager as coach training respectively.FindingsUsing COR theory, the study highlights that manager as coach training is an effective resource for managers in the high resource depletion context of the pandemic. Access to timely support increases saliency for the resource-gain spiral and has a cross-over impact on virtual work team outcomes suggesting transferability of resources from managers to subordinates. Also, managers across all nationalities view coaching training as an equally valuable resource.Practical implicationsThe study provides evidence for investment in timely and relevant support for managers to positively and swiftly impact virtual work teams during high-resource loss contexts.Originality/valueThe study expands COR crossover theory across space and time dimensions using a longitudinal field research design.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-11-2022-0797;From Great Resignation to Great Re-Negotiation on space and time for more holistic individuals and organizations. PurposeThis paper aims to offer a new perspective to conceptualize the Great Resignation from the cognition of space and time, as well as the opportunity to re-negotiate space and time arrangements in personal and organizational lives. As a result, the paper provides new ideas for developing more holistic and sustainable individuals and organizations to survive and thrive in challenges of global disruptions.Design/methodology/approachDrawing from anthropology and psychology works in space and time, this paper proposes new ideas for individuals and organizations to negotiate space and time arrangements that facilitate holistic personal growth and sustainable organizational lives.FindingsThis research raises a critical point on the need to reconceptualize and renegotiate work arrangements about where we work and when we work. Anthropologist Edward Hall suggests that work should be viewed from multiple lenses that connotate different meanings of space and time in different parts of the world. Instead of separating professional and personal lives, we need to cultivate a more holistic mindset and renegotiate space and time settings at work.Originality/valueThis research broadened current conceptualizations of the Great Resignation and organizational behavior around work arrangements. From an interdisciplinary perspective, this paper suggests that individuals and organizations negotiate space and time arrangements for more agile and resilient future.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2022-0058;Does workplace incivility spur deviant behaviors: roles of interpersonal conflict and organizational climate. PurposeBuilding on the conservation of resources theory, this research explored the processes underlying the association between perceived workplace incivility and deviant behaviors. Specifically, we tested a mediating mechanism, an interpersonal conflict that has received less consideration in the workplace incivility literature. The authors also tested the organizational climate (i.e. a resource) as a moderator in the perceived workplace incivility-employees' deviant work behavior relationship.Design/methodology/approachTime-lagged research design was followed to explain the relationship of variables. Survey data were collected at time 1 and time 2 from 220 service sector working professionals to test the proposed model.FindingsThe findings suggest that intrapersonal conflict partially mediates the workplace incivility-deviant work behavior relationship. Further, the authors found that the harmful effects of workplace incivility on employees' deviant work behavior attenuate in the presence of organizational climate as a resource. The results shed light on the beneficial consequences of organizational climate on employees' work behavior by attenuating workplace incivility and mitigating their deviant work behaviors.Originality/valueOverall, the study contributed to understanding the mediating role of interpersonal conflict and the moderating role of organizational climate in explaining the workplace incivility-deviant work behavior relationship.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2022-0048;Who said there is no place like home? Extending the link between quantitative job demands and life satisfaction: a moderated mediation model. PurposeBased on the job demands and resources (JD-R) model and conservation of resources (COR) theory, this paper aims to develop and test a model that examines the moderating role of daily remote work hours and the mediating role of work-family conflict on the effects of excessive workload and time pressure on life satisfaction due to mandatory remote work arrangements.Design/methodology/approachHierarchical regression analysis was used to analyze data from 400 professionals working in the IT sector in Turkey. Scales developed by previous researchers were used to measure excessive workload, time pressure, work-family conflict and life satisfaction. While these four variables were measured with 19 statements, daily remote work hours were determined with a single question. The collected data were validated using confirmatory factor analysis, and the hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling. Furthermore, the reliability and validity of the data were confirmed. Finally, PROCESS was applied to examine moderated mediation.FindingsAccording to the analysis results obtained from the above sample data, daily remote work hours moderate the mediating role of work-family conflict in the relationships between (1) excessive workload and life satisfaction and (2) time pressure and life satisfaction. In other words, the findings show that job-related demands arising from workload, time pressure and remote work hours prevent employees from meeting their family obligations, thereby increasing work-family conflict and ultimately affecting life satisfaction.Practical implicationsThe study can help employers, managers, human resource professionals, policymakers and researchers increase employees' life satisfaction due to the changes in job demands experienced by employees in companies that have transitioned to remote work practices. It can provide new approaches for dealing with dissatisfaction arising from work-related conflicts in Turkey's changing environment. The results can greatly facilitate the Turkish companies' efforts to create more innovative work arrangements and make an outstanding contribution to improving employee performance in Turkey's transition to remote work practices by focusing on reducing workload, time pressure and long working hours and creating employee-centered remote work models.Originality/valueAs per World Health Organization, the world will face frequent pandemic in the coming years, and thus organizations should be aware of remote work practices that will become widespread. This study provides a new perspective on the impact of employees' changing job demands on work-family conflict and life satisfaction during organizations' transition to new work arrangements in the face of the social crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also contributes to closing the research gap between job demands, work-family conflict and life satisfaction.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2021-0775;Humble leadership and employee creative performance in China: the roles of boundary spanning behavior and traditionality. PurposeThis paper examined the mediating role of boundary spanning behavior and the moderating effects of traditionality linking humble leadership and employee creative performance from the perspective of Social Exchange Theory (SET) to reveal the behavioral mechanism and boundary condition regarding the influence of humble leadership on creative performance.Design/methodology/approachA sample of 276 employees and the supervisors from 8 companies in China was taken using two-wave data.FindingsThe results indicated that humble leadership was positively related to employee creative performance, and boundary spanning behavior partially mediated the relationship between humble leadership and employee creative performance. Traditionality strengthens the mediation process when traditionality is high.Practical implicationsThese findings provide several theoretical and practical implications for the domains of humble leadership and boundary spanning behavior. For example, human resource (HR) departments can recruit leaders with high humility and cultivate team leaders through systematic training programs about self-awareness, openness and self-transcendence;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-01-2022-0067;Colleagues' norms regarding work-related messages: their differential effects among remote and onsite workers. PurposeResearch has shown that colleagues' norms promoting the need to respond quickly to work-related messages (CN) have a negative effect on work recovery experiences. In the present study, the authors examine the direct and indirect - through affective rumination and problem-solving pondering - effects of these norms on work-family conflict, family-work conflict and job satisfaction, and verify whether and how these associations differ between employees working onsite (n = 158) or remotely (n = 284).Design/methodology/approachA total of 442 employees completed an online survey that covered measures on CN, affective rumination, problem-solving pondering, work-family conflict, family-work conflict and job satisfaction.FindingsAs hypothesized, the study results revealed that CN were positively related to work-family conflict and family-work conflict, but not to job satisfaction. Moreover, the indirect effects of CN on work-family conflict and job satisfaction were significantly mediated by affective rumination and problem-solving pondering, whereas the indirect effects of these norms on family-work conflict were significantly mediated by affective rumination. Finally, the relations between CN and the mediators (affective rumination and problem-solving pondering) were stronger among employees working onsite than among employees working remotely.Originality/valueThese results revealed that working remotely buffered the detrimental effects of CN on affective rumination and problem-solving pondering.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-07-2021-0484;Work-life balance satisfaction in crisis times: from luxury to necessity - The role of organization's responses during COVID-19 lockdown. Purpose This study examines how satisfaction with work-life balance (WLB) in combination with satisfaction with organization's COVID-19 responses (SOCV19R) helps to enhance subjective well-being and performance during the lockdown due to COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach The data of this time-lagged study were gathered through an online survey with three-waves between March and May 2020 in Spain (N = 167). Hierarchical multiple regression and PROCESS were used to test the hypotheses. Findings Direct relationships between SOCV19R and subjective well-being and performance were not significant. Instead, SOCV19R increased employees' well-being and performance through a higher satisfaction with WLB (full mediation). Originality/value The novelty of this study is the evaluation of SOCV19R as a form of organizational support in times of crisis. This study suggests that a good organizational reaction to face a crisis such as the pandemic, encourages employees' WLB and helps them to boost their well-being and performance. It may be concluded that work-life balance (WLB) in Spain was seen as a luxury in good times and turned out to be a necessity in bad times. The present study recommends practical implications and provides lessons for human resource management for future crises or similar work conditions.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2021-0296;Uncovering the intellectual structure of diversity management research: a bibliometric analysis (1990-2019). Purpose Diversity management has gained researchers' and practitioners' attention because of its competitive advantage and performance outcomes in an organization. Despite increasing literature, there is no common understanding of the evolution and intellectual structure of diversity management. Therefore, this study aims to identify the leading works and analyze the changes in diversity management research's knowledge structure. Design/methodology/approach This study adopts a novel approach using bibliometric methods to analyze the 785 papers published between 1990 and 2019. Bibliometric analysis is applied to identify the seminal work using the bibliometrix package. Findings The bibliometric network visualization findings have highlighted the most influential works, prominent authors, theoretical insights, current research trends and gaps. Several clusters are extracted from bibliometric networks, and cluster analysis has integrated the different unconnected subfields and highlighted the major theme explored in diversity management research. Originality/value This is the first bibliometric study that explored the intellectual structure of diversity management research. This study has provided theoretical and practical contributions for academicians and human resource practitioners and suggested future research avenues.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2021-0362;What if employees with intrinsic work values are given autonomy in worker co-operatives? Integration of the job demands-resources model and supplies-values fit theory. Purpose This study explores the role of intrinsic work values as a motivator in the workplace. By integrating the job demands-resources model and supplies-values fit theory, it also investigates whether autonomy and worker co-operatives can strengthen the intrinsic motivation of employees who have strong intrinsic work values. Design/methodology/approach Longitudinal surveys collected at 25 worker co-operatives and 27 corporations were analyzed with a model in which a moderated mediation model and a mediated moderation model are integrated. Findings The results revealed that individuals with strong intrinsic work values had stronger intrinsic motivation and engaged less frequently in job search behavior. The moderation analyses demonstrated that employees with strong intrinsic work values were more strongly motivated in worker co-operatives than in corporations and that this result was obtained because more autonomy was granted in worker co-operatives than in corporations. Research limitations/implications To date, little research has examined the moderating roles of autonomy and worker co-ops in the associations of intrinsic work values with employee motivation and behavior. The present study contributes to the literature on work values and worker co-operatives by providing evidence that autonomy and worker co-operatives can accelerate intrinsic motivation of employees with intrinsic work values. Practical implications Managers should grant employees enough autonomy and opportunities to participate in decision-making to stimulate their motivation, especially for employees with strong intrinsic work values. Originality/value By integrating the job demands-resources model with the supplies-values fit theory, this study proposes interaction effects of a personal resource with job and organizational resources on intrinsic motivation.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-11-2020-0820;Composing the same song: when and how high-performance work systems can stimulate proactive behavior. Purpose Drawing on signaling theory, the purpose of this study is to explore how high-performance work systems (HPWS) interact with leader-member exchange (LMX) to predict employees' proactive behavior and job engagement. Moreover, the present study also proposes the mediating role of job engagement in the interactive effects of HPWS and LMX quality on proactive behavior. Design/methodology/approach The data of this study include 228 customer-contact employees and 44 store managers from chain store enterprises in the service sector in Taiwan. The proposed models were tested with hierarchical linear modeling and Monte Carlo simulation. Findings The results show a significant interactive effect of HPWS and LMX on job engagement and proactive behavior. In addition, job engagement serves as a vital mechanism linking the interactive effect of HPWS and LMX quality on proactive behavior. Originality/value This study uses signaling theory to unpack the question when and how HPWS can be more influential on employees' proactive behavior. In particular, the positive effect of HPWS on proactive behavior is more prominent only when employees enjoy high LMX quality with their respective line managers. In addition, the interactive effects of HPWS and LMX quality on proactive behavior are mediated by job engagement. The findings provide valuable theoretical and managerial contribution by integrating HRM and leadership research.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-10-2020-0756;Organising to beat the Trade Union Act (2016) voting thresholds: a case study of organising and tactics from the University and College Union. Purpose A retrospective action-research case study of one branch of the University and College Union (UCU) is used to show how threshold requirements of the Act can be systematically beaten. Design/methodology/approach The paper responds to calls for best practice on how trade unions may react to member voting threshold requirements of the Trade Union Act 2016 (the Act). A broader aim is to make a theoretical contribution related to trade union organising and tactics in get the vote out (GTVO) industrial action organising campaigns. Findings Findings are presented as a lead organiser's first-hand account of a successful GTVO campaign contextualised in relation to theories of organising. The findings offer best practice for union organisers required to beat the Act's voting thresholds and also contribute to theories surrounding trade union organising tactics. Research limitations/implications Further development and adaptation of the proposed model may be required when applied to larger bargaining units and different organising contexts. Practical implications The findings can inform the organising practices/tactics of trade unions in relation to statutory ballots. The findings also allow Human Resource (HR) practitioners to reflect on their approach to dealing with unions capable of mounting successful GTVO campaigns. Social implications The findings have the potential to collectively empower workers, via their trade unions, to defend and further their interests in a post-financial crisis context and in the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic. Originality/value This is the first known empirical account of organising to exceed voting thresholds of the Act, providing practical steps for union organisers in planning for statutory ballots. Further value lies in the paper's use of a novel first-hand account of a GTVO campaign, offering a new and first, theoretical model of organising tactics to beat the Act.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-08-2020-0621;Talent management: four buying versus making talent development approaches. Purpose This paper presents a typology exploring employers' perceptions of the quality of available applicants and employers decisions to buy qualified staff vs. to hire available workers and then make i.e. develop them via employer-supported training. Design/methodology/approach This study uses 2015 survey data from Southwestern Ontario, Canada, based on responses from 834 employers regarding their hiring, separations, training and other HRM policies. Findings Among surveyed employers, 10% are Reliants who found the quality of available applicants to be low, yet these employers do not provide employee training. Almost half of employers (at 45%) are Developers who find the quality of applicants to be low but they do provide employee training. Approximately, 7% of employers are Poachers who find that the quality of applicants is high and do not provide employee training, while 38% are Refiners, who find the quality of applicants is high and they provide employee training. Originality/value Employers need to make their training decisions in alignment with their assessment of the quality of job applicants to whom they have access. In this paper, decisions on training and applicant quality are considered concurrently. From an academic viewpoint, the findings raise the issue as to whether other stakeholders (such as educational institutions) are sufficiently helping individuals gain the skills, credentials and work experiences that employers are seeking. If job openings are remaining unfilled because employers are unwilling to hire those available, then applicants lose, employers lose and societies lose.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-12-2020-0878;Employee perceptions of HRM system strength: examining outcome and boundary conditions among HR and non-HR employees. Purpose Studies have explored perceptions of human resource management (HRM) system strength and how they can relate to employee-level outcomes. However, the authors understand little about the boundary conditions for such relationships. Here, the authors apply signaling theory to explain the relationship between HRM system strength and affective commitment as well as the role of an organization's communication climate and organizational collectivism. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted an initial study among HR practitioners (N = 115) to determine their perception of HRM system strength, its outcomes and boundary conditions. The authors then conducted a second study to increase the reliability of our earlier findings by focusing on non-HR employees (N = 179). Findings The findings in both studies indicate that employee perceptions of HRM system strength positively and significantly relate to affective commitment. Moreover, the results show support for the moderating roles of both communication climate and organizational collectivism. These findings are novel and extend the nomological network of employee perceived HRM system strength. Originality/value These findings offer valuable practical insights regarding approaches to strengthen the relationship between HRM system strength and affective commitment. In particular, we offer practical recommendations pointing to the relevance of improving the communication climate as well as the sense of belonging within the organization (organizational collectivism).;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-04-2020-0254;Human resources strategy as a catalyst for the success of the competitive strategy: an analysis based on alignment. Purpose Competitive strategy is one of the key factors traditionally related to performance, but research explaining the mechanisms through which this strategy improves business results is scant. This study aims to shed light on this relationship by analyzing human resource management (HRM) strategy as an essential tool for transforming business strategy into results. Design/methodology/approach Focusing on two generic competitive strategies, the authors establish hypotheses on the need for alignment among four echelons: business strategy, HRM system objectives, HRM system capabilities and business performance. The authors test these hypotheses with structural equation modeling techniques using data provided by 204 industrial companies. Findings The results show that to get the most out of a competitive strategy based on quality differentiation, HRM system objectives and capabilities must be focussed on quality. In the same way, a competitive strategy based on innovation differentiation requires HRM system objectives and capabilities focussed on flexibility to achieve the maximum impact on performance. In this second case, alignment is fundamental in low dynamic environments. Originality/value This research not only provides additional evidence for the strategic relevance of the human resources (HR) function but also reveals the potential benefits of focusing on objectives and capabilities rather than on practices. Moreover, it shows that the role of HRM objectives and capabilities in the implementation of a competitive strategy can be shaped by factors beyond the company's control, such as environmental dynamism.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-06-2020-0458;Occupational stereotypes: professionals‚Ä≤ warmth and competence perceptions of occupations. Purpose The purpose of the current study is to investigate occupational stereotypes among a professional sample of recruiters and other employees on the two fundamental dimensions of warmth and competence. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a survey to collect professionals ' (mostly recruiters ') ratings of preselected occupations. Participants were asked to rate warmth and competence attributes. Factor and cluster analysis were employed to investigate the two-dimensional structure of the warmth/competence space and how and whether occupations cluster as predicted by the stereotype content model (SCM). Findings Almost all occupations showed a clear two-factorial structure, corresponding to the warmth/competence dimensions. A five-cluster solution was deemed appropriate as depicting how occupations disperse on these dimensions. Implications for stereotyping research, the design of hiring discrimination experiments, and HRM are discussed. Originality/value In contrast to previous related research, in which participants select the included occupations themselves, the authors included prespecified common occupations, which should be important for representativeness. In addition, previous research has been conducted in the United States, while the authors conduct this study in a European context (Sweden). Finally, instead of studying students or participants with unspecified work experience, the authors focus on professionals (mostly recruiters).;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-03-2020-0157;Are high performance work systems compatible with the extending working life agenda?. Purpose The paper examines the compatibility of two UK policy priorities - extending working life (EWL) and the promotion of national economic performance through high performance work practices (HPWP). Design/methodology/approach Empirical analysis has been conducted using data from WERS2011 to test hypotheses on whether age moderates the link between HPWP and employee well-being outcomes. Findings Development-oriented human resource strategies are found to compromise the wellbeing of older workers relative to younger ones, while some dimensions of HPWP lead to more favourable wellbeing outcomes for older workers relative to their younger counterparts (flexible working, performance-related pay and appraisal systems). Research limitations/implications At older ages those still in the workforce may be over-represented by happier and psychologically more robust individuals who have settled into jobs they find fulfilling, matching their personal characteristics and abilities. If so, the adverse well-being influence of development-oriented strategies may be understated, while favourable well-being outcomes for older workers may be overstated. Practical implications HRM strategies may need to be more age sensitive to support the EWL agenda better. Originality/value While many studies have examined the link between HPWP and a range of individual-level outcomes, less widely researched is whether responses vary by age, which the paper addresses.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1108/PR-05-2020-0340;Investigating leadership and employee well-being in higher education. Purpose-This article aims to understand the underlying mechanisms through which transformational leadership influences employee job satisfaction and turnover intentions. Specifically, the study explores the mediation role of employee well-being on the relationships between leadership and both employee job satisfaction and turnover intentions.Design/methodology/approach-Employing a quantitative research method, data were collected from 280 academics and professional staff from an Australian regional university. The Mplus software was used for data analysis.Findings-The results showed that transformational leadership had significant positive impact on employee well-being and job satisfaction while it alleviated employee turnover intentions. Furthermore, employee well-being mediated the effect of transformational leadership on employee job satisfaction and turnover intentions.Research limitations/implications-The research was cross-sectional, and data were collected from a convenient sample and therefore minimises our ability to generalise the findings to other contexts.Practical implications-Effective leadership, employee well-being, job satisfaction and employee turnover are of strategic importance in the higher education sector in Australia and internationally. These findings will therefore provide a basis for university policy makers to craft relevant policies that promote effective leader behaviours and enhance employee well-being as they facilitate employee job satisfaction and minimise turnover intentions among higher education sector employees (i.e. academics and professional staff).Originality/value-Our study provides a unique contribution to knowledge as it explains the mediation effect of employee well-being on the relation between transformational leadership a, job satisfaction and turnover intentions.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10.1080/09585192.2019.1579244;Mentorship quality and mentors' work-to-family positive spillover: the mediating role of personal skill development and the moderating role of core self-evaluation. This research examined the influence of mentorship quality on work-to-family positive spillover (WFPS) of mentors by focusing on the mediating role of personal skill development and the moderating role of core self-evaluations (CSEs). The findings based on a survey study of 187 formal Chinese mentors indicated that the positive linkage between mentorship quality and WFPS is mediated by personal skill development. In addition, the influences of mentorship quality on personal skill development is stronger for mentors whose CSE is high rather than low.

The risk of unauthorized remote access of streaming video from networked cameras underlines the need for stronger privacy safeguards. We propose a lens free coded aperture camera system for human action recognition that is privacy-preserving. While coded aperture systems exist, we believe ours is the first system designed for action recognition without the need for image restoration as an intermediate step. Action recognition is done using a deep network that takes in as input, non-invertible motion features between pairs offrames computed using phase correlation and log-polar transformation. Phase correlation encodes translation while the log polar transformation encodes in plane rotation and scaling. We show that the translation features are independent of the coded aperture design, as long as its spectral response within the bandwidth has no zeros. Stacking motion features computed on frames at multiple different strides in the video can improve accuracy. Preliminary results on simulated data based on a subset of the UCF and NTU datasets are promising. We also describe our prototype lens free coded aperture camera system, and results for real captured videos are mixed.;art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
